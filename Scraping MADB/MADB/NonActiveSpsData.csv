15022	False	Active	Saudi Arabia	"Saudi Arabia imposes temporary country wide bans on imports of live animals whenever the country notifies an animal disease outbreak.  Herewith, Saudi Arabia does not follow the international standards of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of which the standards clearly state that trade can continue to take place under certain conditions without banning the whole country.
The EU has measures in place that guarantee the continuation of safe trade when outbreaks of animal diseases occur.  The EU measures are transparent and available to all trading partners.

15388	False	Active	Japan	According to the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health code on infection with Avian Influenza Viruses chapter 10.4 (article 10.4.1, para 3) and 8)) no trade restriction measures should be taken in case of outbreaks of:      •  Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) in wild birds, captive birds or in poultry     •  Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in wild birds or captive birds  Also, according to OIE recommendations trade restrictions should be limited to the defined infected areas in the country concerned and should not include the whole territory of a country. Japan imposes countrywide bans following outbreaks of both LPAI and HPAI unless they entered into a regionalisation agreement. 	False	01 Jan 2006	05 Feb 2020	True	Restrictions related to outbreaks - avian influenza	[{'id': 51, 'sps': True, 'code': '100108', 'name': 'Avian Influenza (AI)', 'parentId': 43, 'active': True}]	"[{'@objid': 2, 'id': 7, 'sps': True, 'code': '0105', 'name': 'Live poultry, that is to say, fowls of the species Gallus domesticus, ducks, geese, turkeys and guinea fowls', 'active': True, 'leaf': True, 'parent': 1, 'section': 1}, {'@objid': 3, 'id': 16, 'sps': True, 'code': '0207', 'name': 'Meat and edible offal, of the poultry of heading\xa00105, fresh, chilled or frozen', 'active': True, 'leaf': True, 'parent': {'@objid': 4, 'id': 9, 'sps': True, 'code': '02', 'name': 'Meat and edible meat offal', 'active': True, 'leaf': False, 'parent': None, 'section': 4}, 'section': 4}, {'@objid': 5, 'id': 35, 'sps': True, 'code': '0407', 'name': ""Birds' eggs, in shell, fresh, preserved or cooked"", 'active': True, 'leaf': True, 'parent': {'@objid': 6, 'id': 28, 'sps': True, 'code': '04', 'name': ""Dairy produce; birds' eggs; natural honey; edible products of animal origin, not elsewhere specified or included"", 'active': True, 'leaf': False, 'parent': None, 'section': 6}, 'section': 6}]"	[{'id': 20, 'code': 'S3000', 'name': 'Agriculture and Fisheries', 'active': True}]
12260	False	Active	Turkey	"On 13 January 2011, the Turkish Under-secretariat of Foreign Trade (later restructured as Ministry of Economy) published in the Official Gazette the Communiqué on initiation of two safeguard investigations (no. 2011/1 and  no. 2011/2). These Communiqués suggested the application of temporary measures by means of a decision increasing duties for goods belonging to HS codes 51.11, 51.12, 52.08, 52.09, 52.10, 52.11, 54.07, 54.08, 55.12, 55.13, 55.14, 55.15 , 55.16 and 61.01, 61.02, 61.03, 61.04, 61.05, 61.06, 61.07, 61.08, 61.09, 61.10, 61.12, 62.01, 62.02, 62.03, 62.04, 62.05, 62.06, 62.07, 62.08 , 62.11. This was followed by the Decision Number 2011/1476 of 24 March 2011 which established that additional customs duties would be provisionally collected. The measure was rendered definite as of 15 September 2011 in the form of tariff increases (MFN rates). Products originating in the EU or FTA partners of Turkey are not subject to additional duties. However, products originating in third countries are subject to additional duties when imported via the EU even if they were in free circulation in the EU.
Since then Turkey has made 26 decisions, each covering a new set of products. Despite the free circulation under the customs union, the measure also applies to third country origin goods entering Turkey from the EU, except where it is proven that the goods originate in the EU or in Turkey’s FTA partner countries. Particularly worrisome is the trend towards higher value-added products, potentially affecting assembly and thus jobs in the EU.
In regard of the latter point particularly, Turkey on 14 June 2019 repealed the extension of this measure to several product lines after the Commission shared its specific concern.
The Turkish authorities decided (Decision no: 2012/3188 of 1 June 2012) that additional customs duty shall not be levied on goods originating in the countries that are included in a system of diagonal cumulation in the context of the FTAs to which Turkey is a party and imported via teh EU, provided that a proof of preferential status of the goods is submitted. In practical terms, this means that the additional duties will not be charged to goods originated in the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean area. Even though this decision was welcomed as a positive development by the EU, the situation remains the same for goods coming from countries not included in Decision 2012/3188, such as the ones to which Turkey has granted preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences.
Over 630 tariff lines are affected by this measure and mainly the following: woven/knitted fabrics (semi-finished textiles) made from wool, cotton or (artificial and synthetic) man-made fibres; Ready-made apparel, such as coats, anoraks, pullovers, cardigans, vests, tracksuits, ski suits, swimwear, underwear, children’s clothing, ties, bed and table linen. 54 % of all tariff lines in the textile and apparel sector (Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature) are covered by the measure.
After that, additional custom duties have been imposed since 2014 on a broad range of other products such as footwear, tyres, furniture, home appliances cosmetics, stationery products, certain steel products, accessories for vehicles and miscellaneous products etc. covered by 25 different decisions.
This barrier is particularly important for the footwear industry.
Additional customs duties of 10%, 30% and 50% on certain footwear products have been applied since August 2014. Footwear originating from EU or FTA partners is not subject to additional duties, but products originating from countries benefiting from GSP preferences are.
In relation to the additional duties, a concurrent problem is the requirement for a proof of origin even when exporting good in free circulation to Turkey with an A.TR movement certificate. On 24 May 2019, Turkey abolished the previous communiqué 2017/4 regarding the implementation of additional duties and introduced a general requirement for a certificate of origin for goods subject to additional duties in its customs implementing regulation. Imports from the EU with an A.TR document are in principle excluded subject to a risk assessment. However, there is no reliable information as to how that system will work. Currently, all such imports therefore de facto need to have certificates of origin issued in addition, a significant concern to all operators concerned."

The UAE legislations of concern are ""The Cabinet Resolution No. (29) for the year 2018 about UAE Regulation for Limited Control on Milk and Dairy Products "" and ""The Cabinet Resolution No. 30 for the year 2018 about UAE Regulation for Control on Juice and Beverage Products"".
These new decrees impose an ECAS requiring certain products to have an Emirates Quality Mark (EQM) certificate of conformity subjected to verification of UAE. This label is already in use mainly for industrial products, but UAE has now expanded this to dairy and juices. For the dairy products the scope is currently linked to eight dairy products including yoghurt. Also some beverages such as fruit juice products will be affected.
These decrees will prove burdensome for EU exporters as many aspects of the decrees remain unclear and will create uncertainties as the decrees do not outline clearly what will be required of suppliers who wish to adhere to this ECAS. The main concern for the EU is that EU establishments exporting these products would need to be sending documentation to the notification bodies (to one of the three notification bodies all situated in the UAE). In addition, UAE requires to perform on-site inspections with at the same time incurring costly registration fees. This would mean an important additional burden and huge cost for the EU exporters while the EU already has a solid food safety inspection system in place.

In the Andean Community Resolution 1587 (which entered into force in May 2013), banned imports on Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) of several products such as: live bovine animals, bovine products and by-products. Concentrated meat containing meat/blood/bone meal, bovine meat, bone meal and mammalian offal meal or food additives that contain ruminant proteins for feed animal use from the countries concerned and with different status of negligible risk, are also banned.
However, this regulation excludes some products such as: milk and dairy products, semen and bovine embryos, sebum without protein, di-calcium phosphate, hides and skins, gelatine and collagen. Also, veterinary products not elaborated with risk products identified in Terrestrial Animal Health Code, as long as these products come from animals of negligible risk, as well the feed for felines and canines which comply with the same requirements, are allowed. Deboned bovine meat of animal less 30 months of age is allowed complying with several conditions.
In addition, for de-bone fresh meat and meat products from cattle, the OIE code states that not import conditions should be set regardless of the BSE status of the exporting country and therefore it can be exported from BSE affected countries following compliance with certain certifications requirements. In the case of other bovine products, the OIE code states that Veterinary Administrations should authorise without restriction the imports of: milk and milk products, semen, embryos, hides, skins, gelatine and collagen.
This measure is against the Terrestrial Animal Health Code.
The following EU Member States are listed in Resolution 1587 2013 because they have reported cases of BSE, i.e. Germany, Austria, Belgium, , Chezch(Rep.) Denmark, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy,  Luxemburg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, United Kingdom, Sweden. The measure indicates that other countries will be automatically added once they report cases to OIE

11169	False	Active	Thailand	"Industrial nitrocellulose
The granting of import licenses for industrial nitrocellulose is a difficult and lengthy process.  This gives an advantage to the Thai sector, which is characterised by a monopolistic structure.  It gives the national producer a large margin to set the price in the domestic market. Profits are used to undercut prices on foreign markets (including the EU) and to increase exports considerably. The import license is not required for non-explosive products, which contain nitrocellulose as an ingredient.
 
Marble and granite 
Thailand applies a discretionary import licensing procedure on worked monumental and building stones including cut and polished marble and granite. Importers need to obtain prior authorisation from the Ministry of Commerce and importation is only authorised for the quantity needed for specified construction projects. Cut and polished stones cannot be imported for other purposes (e.g. kitchen counters, furniture). This licensing system, while aiming at protecting marble processing industry, can be operated as a de facto import restriction to the Thai market. That said, Thailand has never spelled out these licensing criteria in a written form. In early October 2019, the Department of Foreign Trade (regulator) circulated a draft Regulation of the Ministry of Commerce on marble import licensing, which proposes a set of critiera in granting an import license for marble importation. The draft Regulation would only grant import license for the purpose of construction/decoration work of the license applicants (with limited quantity: 200 sqm for individual and 2,000 sqm for juristic person) and not for commercial or for sale purposes. Apart from that the draft Regulation also imposes burdensome documentation requirements to support import license application. EU Delegation sent a letter to the Department on Foreign Trade on 16 January 2020 seeking flor clarification about the justification of the non-automatic import licensing procedure and its timing of implementation. 
Animal feed wheat
As a consequence of depressed prices of domestic maize, Thailand requires since January 2017 an import license for animal feed wheat. Only animal feed millers can apply for an import license and the quantity of imports allowed is tied to the quantity of domestic maize purchased (at a ratio of 3 portions of maize for 1 portion of wheat at a guaranteed price of 8 Baht/KG).  Derogations have been granted since June 2017 for imports of animal feed wheat that is used as input for pet foods or as feed for the production of shrimps. Pet foods and shrimp are important products of Thailand. The issue was raised in the WTO Agricultural and Import Licensing Committees.  The EU requested clarifications as regards the policy objectives of the measure, the licensing procedures and the number of licenses granted. However, Thailand has never provided any substantive reply. Thailand only indicated that the measure aims at protecting poor farmers and will be only a temporary measure (no prospects of revocation provided). Wheat imports from the EU nearly dropped to zero after the implementation of the measure.
The government has launched a support programme for maize production since September 2018 in order to provide incentives for rice farmers to divert their farming to maize during the drought period and to fill in the gap between the domestic demand for maize (8 million MT) and the domestic production (5 million MT). The programme provides both financial (minimum price guarantee, crop insurance premium subsidy and soft loans for inputs and management costs in the post harvesting period) and non-financial supports (marketing and technical assistances) to farmers who switch their farming from rice to maize. This seems to be in contradiction to the alleged market oversupply of domestic maize."

11028	False	Active	China	"China often uses trade restrictive measures, such as export duties and quotas on a broad range of key raw materials. These export restrictions affect all companies operating outside China, including EU companies. As a consequence, EU industry is facing difficulties in securing its supply of primary raw materials, especially when no alternative source of supply or no alternative raw material is available. The consequences of this policy extend to the supply of secondary raw materials.
Besides export restrictions, the EU industry is also affected by the lack of transparency of regulations and procedures affecting various raw materials (e.g. Fluorspar), as well as some restrictions in investment.
Recent reports also show that new discriminatory barriers for the Rare Earth processing industry have been set-up by the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). For example in the Inner Mongolia province, the pre-condition of any company to have their request for a permit evaluated, is that a well-known large local Rare Earths company is given a minimum of 51% share (without any capital investment). This is an unwritten rule that has effectively blocked any new FDI in the sector, even if the foreign companies fulfil all the legal requirements to be granted a permit for a processing plant.
Raw materials currently subject to Chinese export restrictions either in the form of export quotas or export taxes include antimony, cobalt, copper, indium, lead, molybdenum, nickel, Rare Earths, silver, tin, tungsten and wood.
These restrictions have a significant detrimental impact for raw materials such as Rare Earths where China supplies > 90% of world demand. Since 2000, China was applying production caps to regulate the supply of Rare Earths. It has also instated an export quota system, whereby Chinese companies (including foreign JVs) have to obtain a licence to export any Rare Earths. Licences are attributed separately to domestic producers/traders and to foreign JVs. As from 2007, China collects an export duty on Rare Earths, which - depending on the Rare Earth element - can vary between 15 and 25%. The export quotas were reduced significantly to ~ 30.000 MT from ~50.000 MT in 2012.
In January 2015, as part of the process of ensuring conformity with WTO rulings, China removed Rare Earths and molybdenum from the system of export quotas, making them subject to licensing.
On 29 May a press release reported that  the rising tensions between the United States and China could cause Beijing to use its dominant position as a supplier of Rare Earths for leverage in the trade war,  by giving priority to domestic demand. "	True	01 Jun 2009	15 Jan 2020	False	Raw Materials - export restrictions	[{'id': 118, 'sps': False, 'code': '0801', 'name': 'Export prohibition and other quantitative restrictions', 'parentId': None, 'active': True}, {'id': 119, 'sps': False, 'code': '0802', 'name': 'Export taxes', 'parentId': None, 'active': True}, {'id': 120, 'sps': False, 'code': '0901', 'name': 'Pre-establishment requirements', 'parentId': None, 'active': True}]	[14, {'@objid': 39, 'id': 252, 'sps': False, 'code': '26', 'name': 'Ores, slag and ash', 'active': True, 'leaf': False, 'parent': None, 'section': 39}]	[{'id': 13, 'code': 'S1550', 'name': 'Mining', 'active': True}, {'id': 21, 'code': 'S4000', 'name': 'Other Industries', 'active': True}]
15264	False	Active	China	"In June 2019, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) released the draft Measures on the Security Assessment of the Cross-Border Transfer of Personal Information for public consultation. These draft measures replace the 2017 draft “Administrative Measures on Security Assessment of Overseas Transfer of Personal Information and Important Data.” The draft Administrative Measures on Data Security were published for stakeholder consultation in May 2019. The EU submitted comments to both drafts.
Regarding the draft concerning cross-border transfer, there is an increasing trend of new obligations for companies, for example to store and process personal and industrial data in a specific territory of a given country, obligations to keep computing facilities there, or simply prohibit or make cross-border data transfers extremely difficult.
The Measures appear to go beyond their own legal basis in the Cybersecurity Law (CSL) when they extend the scope of the latter's data localisation requirement (art. 37, CSL) from operators of critical information infrastructure (CII) to network operators per se, which can be expected to amplify compliance costs.
The draft measures do not provide concrete information e.g. on the methodology relied on for the 'security assessment', what information will expected to be handed over in the security assessment and whether an appeal mechanism is provided. Furthermore, it is not clear how data transfers within a single (multinational) business group would be treated. The draft is also unclear in terms of reporting obligations to local authorities.
Regarding the Administrative Measures on Important Data, the key provisions in the drafts remain vague and leave considerable room for interpretation. It is not clear how the proposed measures would apply in relation to other measures/guidelines/standards applying to data.
In the current draft texts, it is not clear what is the interaction between the Administrative Measures on Data Security and the draft Measures on Security Assessment on Cross-border Transfer of Personal Information. In case of conflict between these two texts, it is not clear which one would prevail.
Both the “Measures on the Security Assessment of the Cross-Border Transfer of Personal Information” and “The Administrative Measures on Data Security” rely extensively on the notion of ""network operator"". The exact scope of this important notion is not clear in the drafts.
The definition of ""important data"" is still not clearly defined as it comprises ""the kind of data, if divulged, may directly affect national security, economic security, social stability, public health and security, such as undisclosed government information, large-scale population, genetic health, geographic, mineral resources."""

The draft Measures replace the current ""Measures on Security Review of Network Products and Services (for Trial Implementation)"".
The main concern is that the draft Measures remain on a general level and do not specify methodologies and standards to be used during the review. Related, key concepts relied on continue to be only vaguely defined. The possibility of reliance on ""cybersecurity third-party institutions"" to conduct the review or parts thereof is no longer given in this draft.  On top of an initial review, the draft Measures foresee a form of continuing post-market review on the basis of ""spot checks and responding to public reports"" (art. 16) but do not specify conditions under which such additional reviews could take place. Furthermore, the conditions under which ""members of the cybersecurity review working mechanism"" (art. 19) can request a review to take place are not clearly defined and raise the question whether the newly introduced notion of ""information technology services"" (ibid.) will not further extend the scope of application of the draft Measures.
The EU is also concerned that commercial contracts are made conditional on the affected party successfully passing the review (art. 7). The draft does not provide clear description on how the ""non-technical factors"" referred (art. 10 (iii)) as well as influence on the part of foreign governments (art. 10 (vi)) will be assessed.

A wide range of products are affected by these restrictions, in general live birds and their products.
China imposes a country-wide ban on the exporting country whenever there is a notification of Highly Pathogenic avian influenza, instead of limiting the ban to the affected area. China is thus not recognising disease free areas (regionalisation) as foreseen under the WTO SPS Agreement (article 6) and the animal health code of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). 
In addition, China does require a lengthy, non-transparent and burdensome procedure for the lifting of the country-wide ban. The international standard of the OIE clearly states that a free status of the country, zone, compartment, can be regained three months after a stamping-out policy has applied.

Future payments may not be instant (“cash”) as was the case until recently but will have to be subject to a 9-12 months’ delay;
Henceforth the only authorized incoterm will be Free on Board (FOB) excluding all other procedures.

The scope of the measure is currently limited to imports of mobile phones and home appliances assembly kits but but according to the current state of affairs the requirement to utilize FOB only will be extended to all other categories of imported products latest on 31 December 2019.
In addition operators were required to give preferences to national (Algerian) maritime carriers “whenever possible”.
In view of the potentially very negative consequences of these measures on trading conditions with Algeria, on 29 November 2019 the Head of the EU Delegation sent a Verbal Note to the Algerian authorities urging them to check compliance of these measures with the Association Agreement and if need be to withdraw them. A number of European operators and business associations as well as Algerian stakeholders also expressed their concerns over these measures with the Algerian authorities. 
On 25 December 2019 the APBEF issued a new circular to commercial banks, reintroducing the possibility of using other Incoterms (e.g. CF) if FOB is not possible, on condition that the invoice presents a break-down of the respective cost of goods, freight and insurance. As concerns insurance, a separate circular issued on the same day provides that it must be purchased in Algerian dinars from an Algerian insurance company.

Japan introduced an import ban on beef from the EU in 2001, referring to an alleged risk of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). This measure went beyond the international standards set by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and did not take into account the stringent control and surveillance measures in place in the European Union guaranteeing the safety of European beef and beef products.
Japan does not recognize the EU Member States BSE status official recognised by OIE. Instead Japan divides Member States in two categories:
1) Member states with BSE neglible risk or controlled risk status according to OIE and
2) Member states with no detection of BSE
Member states belonging to Group 1) undergoes a burdensome application procedure including inspections and a food safety commission (FSC) risk assessment. For Member States belonging to group 2) a simplified procedure is applied as the food safety commission (FSC) risk assessment is not required.
Age limitation: Japan only accept meat from animals below 30 month. Member States have to apply for export of meat from animals above 30 month. A new risk assessment is required including a new on-site visit.

11405	False	Active	Chile	"The marketing authorisation procedure of new pharmaceuticals and agro-chemicals does not provide enough assurance that tests and other undisclosed data submitted by right holders are not used by third parties to register their ""new"" pharmaceutical products. The implementing regulations for data protection for agro-chemicals do not refer clearly to data exclusivity and, in any event, do not provide clearly for non-reliance.
Industry claims that (i) as per the Chilean law, marketing authorisation has to be applied for in Chile during the first 12 months following its marketing authorisation in any other country, and (ii) their test data are not sufficiently protected when they apply for marketing approval for agrochemicals at the agency in charge of agrochemicals (SAG – Servicio Agrícola y Ganadero). Industry representatives do not receive any confirmation in writing at the moment they submit the application of the fact that they want their test data to be protected. In case of an infringement, companies would not have any legal document to be used in court.
Background
After a lengthy process of discussions and consultations by the Ministry of Health, including mediation by the European Commission, Decree 107 amending and replacing Decree 153 of 2005, was published at the end of 2010 and provided clearer implementing rules for data protection for pharmaceuticals. Decree 107 modified the system of protection of undisclosed data and the marketing authorisation procedure.
Notwithstanding, Chile’s industrial property law 19.039, Article 89, and as reflected in Decree 107, still raises the concern regarding the circumstances in which data protection can be limited or refused in case of publication of some (innocuous) test data on the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) website or in Chile (or elsewhere). In other words, prior voluntary disclosure of innocuous data by the owner made in the interest of transparency can still justify denial of data exclusivity.
Chile’s industrial property law (Art.91(e)), and as reflected in Decree 107, prevent data exclusivity protection if a pharmaceutical or agro-chemical product marketing approval application is filed in Chile after 12 months from the date when the first registration is granted in another country. This is apparently a particularly short deadline for EU companies which may render practically impossible registration and entry on the Chilean market. Although the deadline starts counting from the day of obtaining (and not the filing) the first marketing authorisation internationally, it still is a time limit and not all companies have Chile in their market strategy at the time (e.g., certain virus/the disease may not exist in Chile at the time).
Moreover, this is particularly difficult for agro-chemicals because it seems that Chile’s regulatory requirements for product assessment prevent registrants from meeting the 12 month novelty bar described above. More specifically, before submitting a market approval request, the “Servicio Agricola Ganadero” (SAG) needs to approve experimental trial protocols and requires submission of local seasonal efficacy trial results. Both regulatory proceedings demand at least 24 months to comply with. Thus, compliance with Chilean regulatory requirements prevents meeting fixed deadlines for data exclusivity protection eligibility.
In addition, delays in deciding on the grant of IPRs by the Chilean Industrial property Institute (INAPI), including patents, can be significant. Notwithstanding, modifications to Chile’s IP system considers changes that should expedite and streamline the patent application process. 
On 10 March 2014, the Chilean Service for Agriculture and Livestock (SAG) adopted a regulation on equivalence registry. In order to promote generics, this regulation allows a third party to obtain marketing authorization without submitting test data for molecules without a patent or which do not have data protection. Even if, according to Chilean law, data protection is granted with the application upon request, the company does not receive a document stating that such protection has been required together with the application and the document providing marketing authorization does not confirm that  the protection has been granted.  This leaves the company that first generated the data without legal documentation to defend itself against third parties registration."

11401	False	Active	Chile	"This barrier concerns digital piracy and illegal content on the internet. Chile’s Copyright Law (Law 17.336) was modified in 2010 (Law 20.435) and, although a positive step, it still contains some weaknesses. The reform provides for liability of internet service providers (ISP), increases sanctions, and regulates the extent and scope of private copies. However, it is necessary to strengthen measures against digital piracy and ensure effective action to address illegal content on the internet. A system of notifications by ISPs to subscribers suspected of infringing copyright material came into effect in 2012 and is being used by the six major ISPs representing 95% of the fixed broadband market. The government ran a major public awareness campaign about this system. It is hoped that this system will be effective and avoid a certain number of court cases as having to resort to court orders to take-down illegal material from the internet is time consuming and costly. More enforcement on the streets  (for digital piracy) and at borders (for physical piracy) is necessary. The proper implementation of the law and the notification system has to be monitored carefully.
 
Background
The modified Copyright Law introduces civil and criminal remedies; rules on liability of online intermediaries; mediation and arbitration procedures; rules on collective management societies; increase in all applicable fines; no discrimination between the physical and the digital environment; higher sanctions for piracy on a commercial scale; a list of exceptions and limitations to copyright.
Internet piracy occurs most significantly via peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing of infringing content, but also through hosted sites and, increasingly, illegal mobile downloads. Chile’s amended Copyright Law creates a ""notice plus notice"" architecture but lacks the threat of any real consequences for typical online piracy and fails to impute liability upon an ISP that gains knowledge of infringement outside of a court order. The Chilean law provides for no sanctions in case the online intermediary does not give notice to the infringer within the deadline of 5 days.
The aforementioned factors cause concerns about the effectiveness of the rules providing for the liability of online intermediaries. However, a system of notification to subscribers suspected of infringing copyright came into effect in 2012 and is used by the six major ISPs. The private sector is concerned with the need for the involvement of the judicial system (court order) which is a lengthy and costly process and hopes that the notification system will prove effective in reducing online piracy.
On enforcement, Chile does not envisage the creation of a specialised enforcement agency on ISP liability or any adoption of implementing regulations thereon. Although there is some good cooperation with Chilean criminal and civil enforcement authorities, additional resources are needed to raise street actions and increased prioritization on the part of the judiciary. Police and customs officials take ex officio actions on a regular basis and involve rights holders in legal procedures. However, more enforcement actions would be needed against Internet sites. Prosecutions for copyright crimes are too infrequent and rarely result in deterrent sentencing and civil actions face procedural obstacles and delays."

10080	False	Active	Chile	"Overly bureaucratic process for getting on to the registry for public contracts. Difficult for companies to get academic qualifications of their workers recognised. Applications need many notarised documents (e.g. certificates of good conduct of workers, certification of previous projects), which are very difficult to provide for foreign companies. Projects ask for a ""RUT"" - a local tax identification number which is difficult to obtain for foreign companies. Many original documents are needed as part of the registration process for the ""registro de consultores"". This is time consuming, but also difficult for foreign companies that have worked all over the world and may need to present original documents from various countries. Experience of sister companies is not recognised. More transparency in public procurement is needed, in particular at decentralized level.
This issue was raised at several trade counsellor meetings since 2013 and MAAC since 2014. The EU delegation dialogue with the Ministry of Public works (MOP) and Ministry of Health do not show results so far. The Direction General on Economic International Relations on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has committed to coordinating the work with the ministries involved to ensure compliance with the EU Chile Association Agreement.
Registry for public consultants and contractors:
In August 2014 the EU Delegation provided comments to the Ministry of Public works (MOP) regarding a draft proposal with changes to the regulation of the registry of consultants and contractors. Public procurement, including the recognition of professional titles, was on the agenda of the Association Committee on 2014 and 2015. The EU Delegation offered MOP the possibility to use EU funds (TAIEX instrument) to convey EU best practices through capacity building in the public procurement procedures. So far the response from MOP has not been positive.

Many original documents are needed as part of the registration process for the ""registro de consultores"".
Many unnecessary notarised documents (certificates of good conduct of workers, certification of previous projects etc.) are needed.
""RUT"" (a tax identification number which foreign companies obviously don't have) is required.  
Experience of sister companies is not recognised.
The Regulation on Consultants by the MOP requires, for registration/bidding purposes, consortia with foreign consultants to include at least a national consultant with a minimum participation of 30% of the value of the contract.
The same legislation does also, under certain conditions, prohibit foreign companies from participating in tender procedures.
The regulation relating to public works by the Ministry of Health provides discriminatory provisions giving higher value to local experience (80%) than experience gathered abroad (20%).
Also the application by MOP of dictamen 22728 by the General Comptroller is not recognising experience and/or studies acquired before the recognition in Chile of a foreign diploma. Issues related to the recognition of professional titles (responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) were raised in the Association Committee on 6 November 2014 and 2015.
The Contraloria Dictamen 22728 of 13 April 2011 on the recognition of work experience abroad is discriminatory against foreign workers when applied in the area of public procurement. A meeting on recognition of diplomas between the EU and with the Universidad de Chile, which is the responsible authority for the homologation of professional titles, took place on January 25, 2016.

The Delegation continued addressing the issues during 2017, 2018 and 2019 accordingly.
A tender by the Energy Efficiency Agency included discrimination on foreing experience but the AA is not applicable to the Agency.
In 2018 EUDEL has received issues on discrimination of foreing experience  in a tender by the army (but the AA is not applicable to the Army even if buying under a contract with the Ministry of Public Works) and of local ID requirement in a tender by the Ministry of the Environment.
Public procurement is part of the negotiations for a modernised EU-Chile Association Agreement.

10861	False	Active	Argentina	"Argentina has in place a legal framework in line with TRIPS including a sui generis protection by means of a national register that in principle is also available to foreign holders of Geographic Indications (GI) and Designations of Origin (DO). There are separate regulations for the registration of wines and spirits, on the one hand, and agricultural and foodstuffs, on the other. However, no EU GI or DO has been registered up to date. Without registration, EU GI holders lack legal means to defend their rights in the country. One of the major difficulties is that GI denominations considered as “generic” names cannot be registered, and many European GIs are considered in Argentina and mentioned as such in the local food codex “Codigo Alimentario”. There are concerns on misappropriation of many European GI names.
 
GI protection for wines and spirits is in place since January 2004 (when Law No 25163 of 1999 entered into force) and for agricultural and food products since May 2009 (when law No 25380 of 2001 became effective). 
At the same time the existing Mercosur rules (MERCOSUR/GMC/Resolución N°26/03 - transposing TRIPS requirements) and implemented in Argentina by Resolution 146/2004 on labelling of packaged foods, establishes that the geographical appellations of a country, a region or a population, recognised as places, in which are manufactured foods with specific characteristics, cannot be used for labelling or advertisement of foods manufactured in other places when this can mislead the customer. It prohibits the use of the expression ""type"" to names associated with wines and spirits (TRIPS requirement) but allows it for agricultural products and foodstuffs. This latter increases the risk that those names become ""generic"".
In addition, there is widespread misappropriation of European GI names notably in the wine and spirit sector (for instance private operators try to obtain registration of European GI names, logos or official mentions as trademarks).
In the context of the EU-MERCOSUR negotiations for an Association Agreement, in November 2017 Argentina published for internal consultation (through Resolution 319-E/2017) the list of GI and AO for which the EU requested protection in the territory of MERCOSUR. The outcome of such consultation was an important input for the development of the negotiations."

11284	False	Active	Mexico	"The registration in Mexico of foreign geographical indications (GI) as such used to be impossible and alternatives offered only weak and uncertain protection. This led to a number of imitations and usurpations of European names and GI’s, which affect the access to the market of the authentic products and raise confusion among consumers. The new FTA contains provisions for the reciprocal protection of a selected list of Geographical Indications of the EU; 340 names for foodstuffs, wines and beers will be protected. This is on top of the already existing protection for EU spirits GIs protected through the 1997 EU/Mexico Spirit Agreement, which will also be incorporated into the new agreement, raising its level of protection.     Background  The EU has a wide variety of protected GIs. They represent an important pillar of the EU’s quality policy on agricultural products and constitute a genuine interest for producers as they unlock value by capitalising on consumer’s desire for diversity and quality products.  The registration of foreign GIs in Mexico used to be difficult despite Mexico’s obligations under the TRIPS Agreement, as the national GI legislation was unclear as regards GI protection and inappropriate for foreign GIs.   The registration of a foreign GI as such used to be technically impossible in Mexico, since the legislation stated that the Federal State is the owner of any Denomination of Origin (DO). The only ways for a European GI to obtain some protection within the Mexican territory were to register its name as a collective trademark at the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (IMPI), or when covered by the Lisbon Agreement (of which Mexico is a party) or by the EU-Mexico bilateral Spirits Agreement signed in 1997.
 
Some EU right holders have tried without success for a long time to protect their rights via the trademark system, which handles applications in a sometimes non consistent way  Registration of a GI as a collective trademark does not provide sufficient protection since the compliance to the Mexican quality standard is voluntary (while it is compulsory for Mexican DO), and also because any disputes would have to be solved in court, which involves lengthy, costly and uncertain procedures.
 
In April 2017, the Senate approved a major revamp to the IPR Law, which included some significant changes for national and foreign GIs. The amendments include very important changes with respect to Appellations of Origin (AOs), and for the first time in Mexico specific protection for Geographical Indications (GIs) is included.  Regarding foreign GIs, IMPI will recognise those protected in a foreign country upon the terms of the International Treaties. The owner of a DO or GI protected in a foreign country will be entitled to apply for its recognition by filing an application before IMPI and enclosing the document showing the protection under the laws of the corresponding country or according to the international treaties.  The grounds of refusal, opposition rules and invalidation are set identically as those for national applications. Cancellation, however, will proceed when the document showing foreign protection is not valid any longer in such country.
 
In addition, the new FTA contains provision for the reciprocal protection of a selected list of Geographical Indications of the EU; 340 names for foodstuffs, wines and beers will be protected. This is on top of the already existing protection for 217 EU spirits GIs protected through the 1997 EU/Mexico Spirit Agreement, which will also be incorporated into the new agreement.
 
Before the new FTA comes into force however, EU food products continue to suffer from another widespread practice; the misuse of expressions such as ""tipo …"" or ""estilo …"" on labels. These branding practices generate unfair competition, consumer confusion and contribute to undermining the reputation and image of the genuine products. The latest IPR reform also addressed this issue, with the imposition of administrative offences, as it prohibits the production, storage, transport, distribution or sale of a product equal or similar to those protected  under a DO or GI national Declaratory or those foreign DOs or GIs recognised by IMPI, using any type of indication or element misleading consumers as to the quality or origin of the products, including those as ""kind"", ""type"", ""manner"", ""imitation"" or the like."

A country-wide ban of exports of live poultry is imposed by The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on any EU Member State upon notification of an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in birds, despite that strict EU control measures are imposed on the affected area in line with international standards. 
Such country-wide ban is not inl ine with international rules (WTO SPS Agreement and OIE international standards).

The EU policy applies a strict stamping-out policy in accordance with international rules of the OIE and informs the OIE and trading partners accordingly. It is regretable that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia often lifts its trade restrictions later than this three-month period which is thus considered a barrier to trade.

11860	False	Active	Canada	"Several EU Member States are interested to export seed potatoes to Canada. An application is pending since 2012.  Canada, the United States and Mexico have been working to align the North American regional standard on the movement of potatoes into a NAPPO member country (RSPM 3) with the IPPC standard ISPM 33.  This process is still ongoing.
Traditionally, the import of field grown seed potatoes, in vitro plantlets, microtubers, minitubers and cuttings and other potato propagative materials from markets other than the United States are imported into Canada through post entry quarantine (PEQ).  Statistics show that this import procedure from Canada is not feasible for European exports of seed potatoes as it is considered unnecessarily trade restrictive. The details of access are contained in CFIA policy D-98-01 (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/plants/plant-pests-invasive-species/directives/potatoes/d-98-01/eng/1312247584545/1312247683833).      
The relevant international standard ISPM 33 (IPPC) provides the option of an alternative means to trade micropropagative materials and minitubers.  The new draft of NAPPO RSPM 3 will refer to this process as post entry monitoring (PEM) and will rely on an integrated systems approach to ensure the production of pest free potato micropropagative materials and minitubers.  PEM would reduce the timelines for obtaining the potato germplasm for propagation.  Post entry quarantine will continue. 
At present discussions continue in Canada to align its policy with ISPM 33 and at the same time the final requirements will also need to be consistent with the final version of RSPM 3 (NAPPO).
Despite several requests from the EU, Canada has not been able to provide an indicative timeline on when these alignment procedures towards ISPM 33 (IPPC) will be finalised and thus imports into Canda of seed potatoes from interested EU Member States following the ISPM 33 approach remains blocked.  
According to the EU, a swift treatment of this application should be feasible, given the negligible risk of the good.
The EU continues to raise this issue with Canada at different fora and expects that the pending application process for the imports of seed potatoes into Canada from the EU could be finalised without any further delay.

12161	False	Active	Vietnam	"Vietnam’s system for protection of intellectual property rights has been in place for about 25 years and is thus relatively young compared to that of more developed countries and thus showing some shortcomings. The situation improved after Vietnam's accession to the WTO in 2007 and the WTO TRIPS Agreement. The country’s first Law on Intellectual Property No. 50/2005/QH11 was amended through the Law No. 36/2009/QH12 and brought further improvements in the IPR field. 
However Vietnam's legal framework for IPR protection and enforcement still suffers from a number of weaknesses, such as:

Deficient enforcement of the domestic IPR regulations, burdensome proceedings and lack of efficient customs controls
Criminal prosecution for IPR infringements is unpredictable, given the unclear application of criminal measures regarding piracy and counterfeiting on a “commercial scale”
New level of fines under the IPR-related laws (criminal code and the IPR law) is not deterrent enough to prevent violations. 
Vietnam does not provide for customs controls on goods in transit (IRP law, customs code)
Enhanced protection of Geographic Indications is provided only for wines and spirits, not for other products
There is lack of trained officials with expertise to accomplish their role effectively
Criminal prosecution for IPR infringements is still unpredictable, given the unclear application of criminal measures regarding piracy and counterfeiting on a “commercial scale”.

On 14 June 2019, the National Assembly of Vietnam (Vietnamese Parliament) endorsed the Law numbered 42/2019/QH14 to amend the 2005 Law on Intellectual Property Rights. The new IPR Law enters into force as from 1 November 2019. This new law is endorsed to codify Vietnam's IPR commitments under the CPTPP (which take effect from 14 January 2019) and the EU - Vietnam FTA (which was signed on 30 June 2019). There the new law can be seen positive progresses towards the international standards. Nonetheless it is too early to verify the impacts of the law upon enforcement. New elements of the amended IPR Law include:
Patents
Grace period applicable to utility patents
Under the amended IP Law, an invention will not be considered to lack novelty or an inventive step due to public disclosure if: (i) such public disclosure is made by the patent applicant or by a person that obtained the information directly or indirectly from the patent applicant; and (ii) the patent application is filed within 12 months from the date of public disclosure.
This exception does not apply to circumstances where an invention is disclosed in a patent application or granted patent which is made available to the public or published by a patent office, unless erroneously published or unless the application was filed without the consent of the inventor or their successor in title, by a third person who obtained the information directly or indirectly from the inventor.
Previously, the grace period for public disclosure was much shorter, just six months from the date of disclosure, and applied to only a limited number of circumstances.
Geographical Indications
Determination of whether a term is the common name of goods
Although common names of goods were already ineligible for protection as geographical indications under the previous IP Law, there were no details on the method or criteria for determining whether a term was a common name. Under the amended IP Law, this will now be based on the awareness/perception of the relevant Vietnamese consumers.
Third-party opposition to geographical indication applications
Under the amended IP Law, a geographical indication is considered identical or similar to a registered trademark, or a pending trademark under an earlier application, when the use of such geographical indication is likely to cause confusion (instead of “will cause confusion” under the previous IP Law) as to the origin of the prior trademark. This amendment not only extends the protection of a registered trademark, but also provides another ground for opposition to a geographical indication application, by adding pending trademarks under earlier applications.
Recognition and protection of geographical indications under international agreements
The amended IP Law adds provisions concerning the protection and recognition of geographical indications under international agreements, which were not clearly mentioned in the previous law. Under the amended IP Law, rights to geographical indications can be established under international agreements to which Vietnam is a contracting party, without the need to undergo a separate registration procedure in Vietnam. Accordingly, for a request for recognition and protection of a geographical indication under international agreements, the procedure for publication, opposition, assessment of registrability and determination of the scope of protection for that geographical indication will be implemented similarly to the procedures applied for an application for geographical indication registration filed before the NOIP."

Cumbersome administrative procedures related to export of hygiene products and  cosmetics
In early 2017, FR reported that companies do not face problems any more. ES reported problems, but did not come back with details. Cosmetics Europe reported cost of the registration 560,306  CLP (755 EU) by product, which does not exist in the EU. For Hygiene product, subject to notification process, the product registration cost is 35,461 CLP (48 EU) . Timeframe for the registration is minimum 5 days but could be delayed until 1 month based on the back and forth with ISP. Validity of the registration is 5 years. For a product with different shades (e.g. lipsticks, eyeshadows…) if the formula is not exactly the same (e.g. due to different mineral ingredients), all the shades cannot be registered under the same dossier. It is one application by shade which become extremely costly and time consuming for the companies. In addition to the registration procedure with ISP, a quality control must be done (a certificate of analysis carried out by a Chilean laboratory). The cost of the process varies, depending on the product (30EU to 200EU).
Besides registration, the second issue EU industry is complaining about is the need to provide a certificate of quality analysis for each cosmetic product (CLP 56,000, valid for three years); in order to be exempted, foreign companies need to submit (i) a certificate issued by the country of origin’s authorities (e.g. a certificate of free sale, the Pacific Alliance seems to be working on the abolishment of this kind of certificate), and (ii) an analysis report issues by the manufacturing lab."

13322	False	Active	Brazil	"In late 2015, Brazil opened a consultation on draft standards of identity and quality of wine, grapes and grape derivatives (G/TBT/N/BRA/613),which diverged from international OIV and EU standards on a number of parameters. Brazil received many comments to this draft standard from trading partners, including from the EU.A reviewed version of the standard was then notified in mid 2016 by Brazilian authorities (G/TBT/N/BRA/675) to incorporate the relevant comments received. Since EU comments were only partially addressed, a set of comments was resubmitted to this new version.
The final rule, Normative Instruction 14, was published in the Brazilian Official Journal of 8 March 2018. It foresees a one-year adaption period. Given the concerns that it raised in the EU wine industry, comments to this legislation were again submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture. A revision was made through Normative Instruction 48 of 30 of August of 2018, but it did not solve any of our requests.
The adopted amendment was notified to the TBT Committee on 11 September 2018 as an Addendum to notification G/TBT/N/BRA/613 and WTO Members did have the possibility to submit comments. EU wine industry is worried about future serious disruptions to trade due to the long list of analytical parameters and their divergences with OIV recommendations. The EU has invited Brazil, at the TBT Committee meeting of November 2018, to make use, to the maximum extent possible, of OIV recommendations and to consider accepting imported wines according to OIV oenological practices. The EU is prepared to work bilaterally with Brazil in this respect.
Brazil clarified that the amendment to Technical Regulation 14 is the continuation of a previously discussed measure, raised 8 times by the EU at the TBT Committee. Several bilateral meetings were held with the EU, who also participated in public consultations. Brazil considers that it has been very transparent during the whole adoption procedure and that pertinent EU comments were taken into consideration (6 out of 9 EU comments were taken on board). The Brazilian notification of the amendment as an Addendum follows the relevant TBT recommendations in this respect. Brazil maintains that it has acted in accordance with TBT provisions and that it has provided a 360-day period of transition, even allowing the sale of non-compliant products until the end of the expiration date. OIV standards have been taken into consideration, as long as permitted by legitimate objectives. Brazil recalled that the EU is the bigger seller of wine to Brazil and that it has acted in good faith by providing reasonable opportunities for comments. 
At the bilateral meeting with the EU in November 2018, Brazil noted that the recent amendment was just to correct some errors in the regulation and maintained that the EU had already provided extensive comments on regulation 14. Brazil clarified that they are also bound to respect MERCOSUR regional standards.
 
Products “fora do padrão”: tipicity certifications.   
 
Article 45 of MAPA's Normative Instruction 54/2009 provides that wines and grape-related and wine-related products that do not fall within the Brazilian identity and quality standards (for instance wines with alcoholic content above 14%, or below 8,5%, some sparkling wines) will only be cleared if there is an official certification of the following cumulative requirements: (i) that is a product that has typical characteristics, regional or from the country of origin; (ii) that is a product classified as a wine and, grape-related and wine-related product, under the law of the originating country; and, (iii) that is a product for normal and ordinary consumption and has the name and composition established in the region of the country of origin. According to this provision, the products that do not fall within the Brazilian standards but are protected by a geographical indication, will not require to certify these requirements, being therefore exempted from presenting a ""certificate of typicity"". In this case, a mention in the certificate of analysis and origin about the geographical indication is enough. The article had been implemented erratically by MAPA, however the situation improved for most products following the bilateral contacts of EUDEL with MAPA. The difficulties remain in particular for Spain with regard to sangria and natural cider. It could potentially affect other new products on the EU market without a precise categorisation under Brazilian legislation (blue wine, sparkling flavoured coolers, etc.), if exported to to this country in the future.

Background:
INPI (the national IP office) has undergone restructuring and has recruited 210 extra staff in 2016-2017. This has already contributed to a reduction in backlogs for trademarks from 421.000 cases at the end of 2016 to 191.535 at the end of 2018. And an examination time down to 24 month for unopposed cases, to 12 month at the end of 2018. The new online application system for trademarks also contributed to speed up the registration process. INPI Resolution 248/2019 introduced the possibility of multi class applications. Brazil deposited the accession instrument to access the Madrid protocol on July 3 2019, and the system entered into force for Brazil on 2 October 2019.  For patents according to recent INPI information, the backlog is still estimated at over 208.000 patents at the end of 2018 down from over 243.000 in 2016. The important decrease in the backlog in 2017 was due to higher efficiencies and new processes, but also to a cleaning up process, where incomplete or expired applications were removed. Average patent examination times stand at 10 years with the pharmaceutical patents taking over 13 years on average. There is a supplementary procedure in patent applications in the pharmaceutical sector as they require the prior consent from the National Sanitary Agency (ANVISA).  In 2019 INPI introduced a new backlog reduction plan, that includes (for patent applications, submitted after 31/12/2016, or with no third party observation, or not already submitted to first technical examination by INPI, or not under any other fast track mechanism)the use of prior art search carried out in foreign IPO, and a simplification for applications where not such search has been carried out.
The Ministry of Health (ANVISA) has a power of veto (for public health reasons) on pharmaceutical patent applications set out in Joint Order ""Portaria Conjunta No.1"" of 12 April 2017 on the working arrangements between ANVISA and INPI. ANVISA would not, however, interfere with the patent examination based on patentability criteria set out in international law.

2011 saw the introduction of restriction to this liberalization, with minimum contracting to local insurers, restrictions to intracorporate transfers and to transfers to occasional reinsurers. In 2015 Brazil introduced new regulation to gradually reduce the restrictions on obligations to contract to local reinsurers and limits to intracorporate transfers.
In December 2017, the CNSP introduced resolution 353/2017 that eliminated the restrictions to intracorporate transfer, and the obligation of a minimum contracting to local insurers.
As of 2018 the remaining issues are:

The maximum of 10% contracting to occasional reinsurers.
The obligation to offer 40% of reinsurance contracts to local reinsurers . 
A recent change in the applicable tax regime (BR tax authority reviewed in 2017 the way the admitted reinsurers are taxed): they used to be taxed a 2% revenue tax + 0.38% financial transaction tax.

Ceramic tiles are retained by the Tunisian custom authorities in the port at least for 2 months before the cargo is allowed to enter the market. This causes an increase in the cost of the final price.

Since 2006, ceramic tiles have to qualify for technical requirements (“cahier des charges”) while these requirements do not apply to local production. In the last years, it has got more complicated to obtain the approval of the authorities regarding the technical requirements. The procedures to obtain the approval are blocked constantly. The authorities have seven days to check the goods but they do not fulfil the time limitation. Samples have to be tested twice a year.
Ceramic tiles imports have to pay as all the other imported products a 10% of the imported value before they can enter the Tunisian market (“avance d’impôt”) but also an additionnal 10% as the excise taxes since January 2018.

10402	False	Active	Australia	"Long a hold out amongst advanced economies, Australia has finally committed to join the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), submitting its initial offer in July 2015 and a revised offer in October 2016. This provides an opportunity to seek to address outstanding access issues, particularly at the sub-central level (the Australian States and Territories) where non-discrimination has not been adopted as a key principle, and some discriminatory measures remain in place.
At the central (Commonwealth) level, the Australian Government Procurement market is largely non-discriminatory and transparent, governed by the Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPR) which follow a devolved model were Chief Executives of each government entity manage their own procurement within a centrally prescribed framework. This framework is built around the core principle of achieving value for money through competition (i.e. non-discrimination); efficient, effective and ethical procurement; accountability and transparency; consideration of risk; and conducting a process commensurate with the scale and scope of the procurement. Additional requirements exist for procurement above certain thresholds, but a number of ""sensitives"" sectors – including property and accommodation, motor vehicles, research and development services, defence-related procurement, blood plasma products, business servicing the disabled, and indigenously-owned SMEs - are exempted from these additional requirements (these sectors are also generally exempt from coverage of the procurement chapters in Australia’s FTAs). The CPRs also include a target for non-corporate government agencies to source at least 10 per cent of procurement by value from SMEs (defined as an Australian or New Zealand firm with fewer than 200 full-time equivalent employees). Australian officials argue this does not imply any discrimination in favour of SMEs, as the CPRs elsewhere make clear that SMEs will win government business only if they are competitive. In practice, SMEs' share of Commonwealth procurement far exceeds the 10% target (34.4% of total value for 2013-14, 32% for 2012-13, 29% for 2011-12), and therefore the question of discriminating in favour of SMEs to meet the target would not seem to arise.
In November 2016 the Australian Finance Minster announced a number changes to the CPRs to come into effect in March next year. In particular, new rules having been introduced requiring tenderers to provide evidence that they have the capability to meet the Australian standard applicable for goods or services being procured, and mandating Commonwealth officials consider the economic benefit of the procurement to the Australian economy (for procurement above A$4  million). The Australian Governments asserts that these changes are compliant with the procurement provisions of Australia's FTAs.
At the sub-central level, State and Territory governments each have their own policies and legislation governing procurement. While a number of the state government procurement regimes have been moving towards devolved and more transparent and simplified systems similar to arrangements at the federal level, they have not adopted non-discrimination as a key principle, and retain measures aimed at boosting domestic suppliers and local content, particularly SMEs. Sub-central governments may require suppliers to meet a minimum local content in public procurement for ""strategic"" projects (e.g. Victoria) or may impose weighting for local content criterion in tender evaluation (Victoria, South Australia). Western Australia retains a price preference scheme in which it imposes surcharges on goods with a certain proportion of imported content, which works to the advantage of Australian and NZ suppliers. WA Government agencies, when comparing bids, apply a 20% price preference to the portion of a bid that comprises a good, service or items that have been sourced from overseas, excluding New Zealand. However, countries possessing free trade agreements under which state governments are bound by procurement provisions (currently New Zealand, the United States, Chile, Korea and Japan) are excluded from these schemes and requirements.

By using such names, Australian producers can take advantage of, but also could potentially damage, the reputation of EU GIs.
The Australian position is that GIs, as intellectual property rights, are private rights, and it is the responsibility of a right holder to enforce their rights against infringers.

Art 72 of law 8383/91 provides for an exemption of the OIF (financial transaction tax of 3% on loans) tax for the same categories of beneficiaries for the purchase of domestically produced cars with a maximum of 127 HP.
In 2009 this exemption was extended to Vehicles of Mercosur origin with law 12.113/09 that modified art 4 in the original law.
An exemption to the ICMS State tax is also given through Convenio ICMS 38/01 (taxis) and convenio ICMS 38/12 (people with deficiencies). For taxis this applies to new vehicles with an engine of maximum 2000 cc, and for people with deficiencies it concerns vehicles that cost less than 70.000 BRL. The exemption 38/01 for taxis extends the exemption to Mercosur produced cars (Clausula 12), while there is no similar clause in the one 38/12 for people with deficiencies. The ICMS tax is a state tax and the rate varies between 17% and 18% depending on state. 
Bill (PL 8353/17) presented in the Chamber of Deputies would grant exemption from the IPI for vehicles purchased by rural producers who prove that they have carried out the activity for at least five years. The IPI on this particular type of vehicles can range from 7% to 15%.

10984	False	Active	Brazil	"Lack of alignment with OECD practices in respect of transfer pricing, business profit and intra-group tax rules together with complex domestic taxation systems which include multiple cascading and discriminatory taxes that pose numerous challenges to EU companies operating in Brazil.
 
Background Although the Federal Government presented a proposal for a tax reform in the year 2009 with the objective of simplifying the indirect tax system and reducing the tax burden, given the numerous problems triggered by the complexity of the previous system, not much has been achieved so far. The only modifications were limited to replacing corporate social security charge by a lower charge applied to corporate revenues. The tax reform was claimed to be a priority of Dilma Rousseff's administration after the election of 2014, however no specific projects were made public. Under President Temer's administration the tax reform was included as one of the key economic reforms that the government was intending to present to Congress. However, because of the political situation in Brazil, no new reforms have been presented. So far, since 2014 the only modifications was the introduction of differential tax rates for domestic and nationally produced goods (PIS/COFINS) with the aim of compensating for the difference in taxable base between the two taxes due to an STF decision. This added to the complexity and ambiguity of the system in particular in relation with imported products. Additional main concerns for EU operators pertain, in particular, the lack of alignment with OECD practices when calculating the transfer pricing, the CIDE tax, levied on the transfer of any kind of ""technology"", the high tax rates applied to imported perfumes, the increase of PIS/COFINS levied on imports and the Reintegra programme for tax reimbursements of exports.
 The main concerns of EU companies are:

Lack of alignment with OECD practises regarding transfer pricing of business profit and intra-group tax rules. Law 9.430 of 1996, as modified by Law 12.715of 2012, establishes three transfer pricing methods. Firstly, the ""Método dos Preços Independentes Comparados"" (PIC Method) whereby transfer pricing is defined as the average price of identical or similar products, services or rights, in the Brazilian market or in other countries, in sale transactions made by the company or by a third party, under similar payment conditions. Secondly, a specific ""Método do Preço de Revenda menos Lucro""(PRL Method) whereby transfer pricing is defined as the average resale price of the final product, services or rights and a profit margin of 40%, 30% or 20% depending on the economic sector of the company. Thirdly, the ""Método do Custo de Produção mais Lucro"" (CPL Method) whereby transfer pricing is defined as the average cost of products, services or rights, plus taxes and a profit margin of 20%. These calculations methods may differ from the result of the arm’s length principle, which is advocated by the OECD rules where transfer pricing of intra-group transactions must be the same as if the parties were not related. The methods applied may lead to a tax distortion, when calculating tax revenues of the host countries, and lead to double taxation issues.
Problems related to taxation of ""technological knowledge"" transfer due to the discriminatory nature of the CIDE tax (tax on the contribution for intervention in the economic domain), which was established by Law 10168/2000 and further complemented by Law 10332/2001. CIDE is collected to provide financial support to priority scientific and technological development programs and projects. CIDE is levied on payments made by Brazilian companies to foreign suppliers which provide inter alia some kind of ""technological knowledge"" such as patent assignments, trademarks or technical assistance services. Since 2006, CIDE no longer applies to software, except when it involves transfer of the corresponding technology (Articles 20 and 21 of Law 11452/2007). CIDE amounts to 10% of the underlying transaction. However, the retroactive effect of the law with regard to software only goes back to 1 January 2006. By contrast, Brazilian companies are not subject to CIDE when they pay for the acquisition or use of domestically produced ""technology"".
Taxation of perfumes versus ""eau de toilette"" – Due to the lack of fiscal or custom legislation that precisely defines perfume and ""eau de toilette"", Brazilian fiscal administration uses Decree 79094/77, which was complemented by a sanitary regulation, making the distinction between these two products on the basis of their respective concentration of aromas. As a result of this distinction, Brazilian importers (ADIPEC - Associação dos Distribuidores e Importadores de Perfumes e Cosméticos) confirmed that most Brazilian domestic products are classified as ’eau de toilette’ and taxed at an IPI (Tax on Industrial Products) rate of 12%, while most of imports from the EU are considered to be perfumes and taxed at 42%. The issue was also dealt with at EU-Brazil Joint Committee meetings. No progress was reported. However, according to the Ministry of Finance the differentiation was first introduced by decree 3.777 in 2001 and Brazil is in a right stemming from the Constitution to apply a higher tax to products considered a luxury good due to the higher concentration in essence/aromas of perfumes.
Introduction of an increased rate of PIS/COFINS for imports - PIS and COFINS increases for imported goods were officially introduced by the Provisional Measure (MP) 668/15 adopted and published on 30 January 2015. The combined PIS/COFINS rate for imports was increased generally by 2.5 percent (from 9.25 percent to 11.75 percent) with a higher increase for certain specific categories of products (pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, tyres etc.). The increased contributions applied as of 1 May 2015 (90 days after the publication as per the constitutional requirement). The MP 690/2015 was adopted by the Congress and published as Law 13.137/2015 of 19 June 2015.. Furthermore some imported products are subjected to a supplementary 1% PIS/COFINS tax, without the possibility of earning a tax credit. The tax hikes and credit restrictions affect only imported goods, which thereby are placed at a competitive disadvantage in the Brazilian market. According to the Brazilian Government, the rationale for the tax increase relates to a need to compensate for the difference between the taxable bases for imported products (that following the Supreme Federal Tribunal –STF – Ruling 55937/2013 and in accordance with the Constitution must be the customs value, without adding any other taxes or charges) and for domestic companies (where other domestically paid fiscal burdens are included i.e. ICMS).An STF ruling excluding ICMS from the calculation base of PIS/COFINS domestic was issued on the 9th of March 2017. This diminishes the differentiation of taxable base between PIS/COFINS domestic and import and thus increases the discrimination of the tax. The judgement was published and took effect on the 2nd of October 2017, but there is still a possibility to modulate the judgement, meaning that there will be a decision on its retroactive effect. In the start of 2018 Receita Federal (tax authorities) had still not taken measures to stop including the ICMS in the PIS/COFINS tax base.
Reintegra - Law No. 12,546 of 14 December 2011 introduced the Special Regime for the Reimbursement of Taxes for Exporters, known as Reintegra. The programme enables exporters of manufactured goods to recover residual Indirect tax costs levied on the production chain, such as the Tax on Services (ISS), the financial transaction tax (IOF), and the royalty tax (CIDE). Under the current rules the exporter does not have to provide any calculation proving that the sums reimbursed corresponds to internal taxes imposed on the exported products. BR thus does not have a system in place that ensures that the reimbursed amount does not exceed the amount of indirect taxes paid. Companies that export goods manufactured in Brazil are entitled to a refund of their gross receipts from exports, to be used either as a credit against federal tax liabilities, or as a cash payment. Manufactured goods must: (i) be included in the Industrialized Products Tax Table ( Tabela de Incidência do Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados – TIPI) and listed in an act issued by the Executive branch; and (ii) the cost of the imported content of the goods must not exceed a percentage of their export price. Decree No. 7.633 of 1 December 2011 provides a list of eligible goods and sets the maximum value of imported content at 40% for most products, except in the case of high-tech goods (e.g. pharmaceuticals, electronics, and aircraft and parts), which may have up to 65% of imported  inputs.  Imported goods do not benefit from the programme. Reintegra benefits were applied to exports made until 31 December 2012 with a reimbursement rate of 3%. %. It was then reinserted in 2014 with law 13.043/2014. The general Reintegra credit established by Decree 8.415 of 27 February 2015 was 3%. By means of Decree 9.148 of 28 August 2017, the Reintegra credit was reduced temporarily to 2% from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2018. Decree 9.393 of 30 May 2018 reduced further the Reintegra credit to 2% from 1 January 2017 to 31 May 2018 and to 0.1% from 1 June 2018 on.

Sales of EU wines are only possible via the liquor boards while domestic products in some provinces can be sold either through private outlets, farmers markets or enjoy better selling space in supermarkets (British Columbia). [Note: Wine producing provinces like Ontario and Quebec, permit direct sales of Canadian wines in their place of production; in British Colombia and Ontario a limited number of off-site private stores has been granted to the wine producers and in Quebec, wine that is bottled in the province, can be sold in grocery stores; a number of provinces also allow the sale of Canadian wine at farmers markets, while sales of EU wines is only possible via the liquor boards. Though the prices in the private outlets are required to be the same as in the liquor boards, some product mark-up are not applied in the private sales outlets resulting in a more lucrative route-to-market available only to domestic wines. These practices are allowed under our 1989 bilateral agreement, but CETA includes a commitment to reach mutually agreed solutions on any issues of concern regarding Wines and Spirits, and notably on the discriminatory mark-ups applied in private wine outlets.] • Ontario authorises the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) to apply an additional reduction of 5% on all sales of Ontarian wines to restaurants and bars. New selling formats such as bag-in-a-box one are hardly available for imported wines in Ontario. • New sales targets reflect double-standard for Ontario vs imported wines. Wines risk to be routinely de-listed for failure to reach the quota.   In addition, the increase of 2% in excise duties on foreign wines has been included in the 2017 Federal budget. It will be adjusted every year (on April 1) to reflect yearly inflation. This excise duty is not applicable to Wines made from 100% Canadian-sourced grapes/fruits.
All of these discriminatory practices raise the cost of imports and hinder entry into the Canadian market by producers of European alcoholic beverages, thus putting them at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis domestic suppliers and partly also vis-à-vis importers from third countries (mainly NAFTA)."

This measure results from the implementing decrees of Law 24/09, concerning the Safety of Products and Services.
The measure applies to several electrical equipment designed for incorporation into other apparatus and equipment for use as such. Although the Cmim marking is largely equivalent to the European CE marking, the latter will no longer suffice on products imported into Morocco.

In practical terms, for obtaining Cmim marking, indispensable to access the market of Morocco, the products will have to be submitted to conformity assessments on security and electromagnetic compatibility. For the assessment, it is mandatory the preparation of a “technical dossier” containing information on the conception and production of the material, including circuits, components, and also designs on the functioning of the products.
In response to concerns from importers and to facilitate the adjustment to the new system, and following an additional extension of the transition period over the summer, the Ministry has given the possibility to importers, upon arrival of the goods to Morocco, to affix the marking up to 31st of December 2019.

During the last years China has issued a series of legislative initiatives taken on the ostensible grounds of “national security”. Many of them relate to cybersecurity. Generally, these measures include very broad and vague definitions, which create uncertainty and implicitly leaves the Chinese Authorities with the option of undermining foreign market access on the basis of unclear and broad considerations.  These measures have raised a number of additional concerns such as mandatory requirements to use domestic cryptography only and to apply Chinese national standards instead of international standards, disclosure of source code, which would amount to the disclosure of business secrets, data localisation requirements, etc.
The “Cyber Security Review System”, announced in May 2014 is part of this trend. The IT banking guidelines was one of the first initiatives under this approach. They required domestic banks as well as foreign incorporated banks to progressively increase their expenditure on ""secure and controllable"" IT to reach the level of 75 % by 2019. The banking guidelines were suspended after strong international pressure, but China has issued a similar draft initiative for the insurance sector. Other sectors are also expected to follow.

The latter products (which, for instance, use cryptography as a feature for digital signatures, authentication or verifying product authenticity) are in general not subject to licensing requirements or any similar regulatory constraints. To strike a balance between security and industry development and ensure that the Law is not more trade restrictive than necessary, the EU suggests narrowly defining the kind of cryptography products falling under it, and, in line with SCA's (then OSCCA’s) so-called Year 2000 Clarification, ensuring that only such products fall under it the core function of which is encryption.

(A separate market barrier ID 13562 exists on the nature of these compulsory standards and their verification system, while the cumbersome aspects related to the conformity assessment procedure due to capacity constraints will be dealt with in this market barrier.)
Since the introduction for electrical and electro-technical products of new compulsory requirements for energy efficiency in 2014 (VC9008), adding to the safety and energy saving requirements (VC8055) already in place, NRCS has come under strong criticism due to critical delays in the issuance of LoAs by its electro-technical unit, taking on average between 240-500 days (previously max 120 days but usually significantly less).
Though equivalence of standards and different testing formulas are contemplated, these are costly and burdensome; and with regards to energy efficiency testing, despite various failed attempts there continues to be no national testing facility, forcing testing to be done abroad. Nonetheless, once testing is complete, a LoA can only be issued by a capacity constrained NRCS with no effective online risk based procedure in place. The current manual process also lends itself to lack of transparency, consistency and predictability. An added layer of complication is the fact that in SA there are currently no energy efficiency testing facilities (failed attempt in 2017, new promise for early 2019).
The delays in LoAs issuance have a negative effect on importers, foreign manufacturers and the domestic industry alike, affected by staggering demurrage costs, losses of sales revenues, and delays in projects that need specific electrical and electro-technical components.
To further complicate matters, since 2017 many of these products also need to obtain an EMC/EMI CoC from SABS based on a costly third party verification process (SABS Authorized Laboratory (A-Lab) Program) for which there is no equivalence of standards or an ILAC Mutual Recognition Arrangement. There was also no national reference laboratory in South Africa until December 2018 (1 accredited laboratory) and 2 in the EU (as of December 2018). The revised conformity assessment procedure for the issue of CoC was submitted to the WTO who authorised SABS to implement the measure while under revision (notification 22 September 2017). Nonetheless, as of December 2018 the measure had not been enforced by SABS.
Update 2019:according to NRCS annual report: Testing constraints – In certain instances local test facilities are not accredited to test or have no capacity or capability to test. For example, there were no local test facilities to test the energy efficiency requirements of air conditioners.
When enforced, this will add another layer of costs and time in obtaining a LoA from NRCS to put the product on the market, as NRCS will only issue a LoA for energy efficiency and safety if accompanied by a EMC/I CoC issued by SABS..
NRCS presented a detailed set of targets and a performance plan (including an online risk based management system) to the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry on 14 September 2016 to resolve the backlog of LoA. Shortly after, the CEO of NRCS presented its resignation. Frequent contacts with the EU industry and NRCS intervention in Parliament March 2018 still show that much of this has not been implemented and the backlog is once again starting to build up after short term measures where implemented last year.
Both NRCS and SABS fall under the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). NRCS has been without a permanent CEO until September 2018, and SABS has been placed under administration by DTI since June 2018.
There were recent signs in 2018 that government is prioritizing this issue: DTI has secured extra funding to deal with LoAs and is working together with industry and NRCS to find workable solutions (working group established mid-2018, EU facilitating and participating – see annexed minutes). Also new acting leadership in SABS appears to be determined to improve matters. SABS committed to engaging with industry ahead of EMC/I enforcement to explain procedure.
2019: working group has been dissolved and SADA is engaging directly with DTI and NRCS. turn around times stil at 90-120 days for bulk of Appliance LOAs

- a tax exoneration only for locally produced new vehicles;
- an obligation for the car dealers to start an industrial, semi-industrial or ""any other activity related to the automotive sector"" by 1st January 2017;
- an obligation for car dealers to import a specific quota of vehicles equipped for using LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and LNG (liquefied natural gas).
New measures on car dealership and mandatory safety standards for imported vehicles were introduced between February and July 2015 (Executive decree n° 15-54 of 7 February 2015, ministerial decision of 23 March 2015, ministerial decision of 12 May 2015, and ministerial decision of 23 July 2015). These regulations also confirm the requirement already contained in the Budget Law 2014, that car dealers carry out an activity of industrial or semi-industrial nature on top of the dealership (subject to a period of grace of three years, expired on 1.1.2017). The measures also require additional, mandatory safety equipment for all imported cars (it remains unclear whether similar requirements are applied to domestically manufactured vehicles).

15202	False	Active	Dominican Republic	"Since beginning of 2018 the General Directorate of Internal Taxes (DGII) of the Dominican Republic has been developing a traceability system (known as Sistema Trafico) to tackle very high rates of illicit trade and tax evasion in the sector of alcoholic beverages and cigarettes (40% in 2018). The initiative was supported by the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic, mainly concerned with protection of national rum producers, affected by smuggled/adulterated produce. The system will be applicable to all alcoholic beverages and cigarettes (domestic and imported), establishing control and traceability of each product marketed in the Dominican Republic from their initial production to final consumption. The main feature of the system will be the compulsory labelling of each bottle, containing a unique code and serial number, as well as special authentication marks to prevent fraud. The final consumer will also be able to scan the code with a special application for mobile phones. National producers of alcoholic beverages (mainly rum and beer) with higher volumes of production will be able to integrate the labelling process in their production lines, so that the labelling will be done automatically. Importers will need to place the label manually on each bottle. It is not clear where this process would take place (at origin or at destination).
The system still lacks implementing regulations and is only based on Art. 17 of the recently adopted Law 17-19 on the Eradication of Illicit Trade, which empowers regulatory bodies to establish traceability systems for inputs and finished products to prevent smuggling and tax evasion.
The System has been developed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), entrusted with the tendering process. The tender was awarded to the Swiss company SICPA in April 2019 who will be the provider, developer and implementer of the system. It was supposed to be ready by November 2019 for alcoholic beverages, however, to date it has not been integrated in the system of the Customs Administration (Integrated Customs Management System SIGA). 
The national alcoholic beverage production sector has been granted a series of facilities to implement the new system. SICPA, the company that won the contract for the implementation of Trafico, must install the marking equipment directly on the automatic and semi-automatic production lines. Therefore, the equipment and processes vital to comply with the requirements of the System by the local production will be fully covered by the supplier.
For imported products, indirect marking (adhesives) should be used, which may be applied at origin or in the Dominican Republic. In the case of imported beers, depending on the volume imported from the same manufacturer at origin, they can make use of direct or indirect markings according to DGII authorization; for such cases, software for imported beers will be developed, that allows the assignment of codes for printing of markings by the manufacturer, this must be done under the same formats applied in local beers. The costs associated with the adaptation of the software for the printing system as well as the necessary machinery must be covered by the importer. Therefore, contrasting the conditions under which the importing sector must implement the Trafico System with the facilities granted to the national producer sector, there is a clear disadvantage that will negatively affect the competitiveness of the imported product in the national market."

Since December 2011, several EU Member States have reported a previously unknown virus in ruminants (cattle, sheep and goats), named ""Schmallenberg virus"" (SBV). There is no evidence that it causes illness in humans while in ruminants it causes non-specific clinical signs in cattle and congenital (present at birth) malformations, mainly in sheep and more seldom in cattle and goats. SBV is not an OIE listed disease. OIE standards clearly establish that only OIE listed diseases should be included in international veterinary certificates. In addition, countries are obliged to ensure that import measures are not more trade restrictive than those applied within the country. Brazil has not provided information about the presence /absence of the virus on its territory.
According to Mercosur Resolution, MERCOSUR/GMC/RES. N. 45/14, which was adopted on 27/11/14, EU Member States that have detected SBV in their territory can continue exporting bovine animals and genetic material (like embryos and semen) only if the relevant certificate includes information on SBV testing before and after semen collection. The resolution introduces some flexibility but has not addressed the problem of seropositive bulls.

14586	False	Active	Argentina	Law 27,263 of 2016 established the “Regime of Development and Strengthening of Argentine Autopartism” (RDFAA) which includes different local content requirements (LCRs). Under this regime, car and auto-part manufacturers in Argentina obtain a tax benefit as a result of using a specific percentage of Minimum National Content (MNC) in the production of specific types of cars and auto-parts. The MNC varies between 10% and 30%, depending on the vehicle or auto-part produced. The tax benefits consist of a digital tax credit bond that can be used for the payment of national taxes. The value of the tax bonus ranges from 4% to 15% of the ex–factory value of the parts of national origin used in the production of the vehicles and auto parts listed in the Law. If both the development of local providers and the expert of the concerned products of national origin in significant volumes can be proven, it is possible to request an increase of up to 5 percentage points on the national content in order to reach the MCN. The beneficiaries may request in advance up to 15% of the total benefit foreseen during the first five years of the approved production program for the development of local providers.

Background
Despite efforts to curb IPR infringements, the situation remains problematic for foreign companies in Argentina. According to EU companies, the main concerns regarding the Argentinean IPR regime include delays in patent examination and the absence of effective regulatory data protection.

10863	False	Active	Argentina	"Being Argentina a federal country, all government levels (Nation, Provinces and Municipalities) have the power to establish preferences to the public procurement of goods and services of national, provincial and/or municipal origin. In addition, public companies or decentralized entities may have their own public procurement regimes.
 
At national level, Law 27,437 of 2018 established a new “Buy Argentina” (""Compre Argentino"") regime. The Law adopted by the Congress in April 2018 and published in May 2018 contains various discriminatory provisions in favor of national compaor goods and services.
 
Main provisions:

The law establishes that public entities shall grant a preference for companies offering local goods in their purchases, when the difference with imported goods is equal to or less than of 15% for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and 8% for other companies. Such preference is mandatory above a relatively low threshold (in May 2018, equivalent to approximately €63,000).
The above-described preferences of 15% and 8% can be reduced to 5% for the acquisition of goods of high technological scientific content (except for SMEs during the three first years from the enforcement of the Law).
The law foresees a mechanism to provide incentives, in case of competition among goods that do not have a national origin, to those goods that contain the highest percentage of local content: offers without national origin have a preference margin of 1% every 5 percentage points of national content in the gross production value of the goods, up to a maximum preference of 8%.
In addition to the above, the Law also includes specific preferences for national MSMEs. MSMEs offering goods of national origin in binding processes will have the possibility of improving their offers when their price has not exceeded more than 20% the best price in the process. In case of contracts of up to ARS 1.3 million in goods or ARS 100 million in works in housing and public buildings, the national administration shall award their contracts to local MSMEs that offer goods or works of national origin.
The Law applies at central level but also contains a mechanism aimed at encouraging Provinces to adhere to the Law: there is an additional preference of 1% for goods produced in Provinces adhering to the Law, within three years of its entry into force.

 
Most Provinces and some Municipalities have also established preference regimes that favour local bidders. The thresholds depend on each jurisdiction, although have been normally set around 5% (however, they may start revising them in line with the new national “Buy Argentina” Law). Bidders are considered local if they offer goods produced in the concerned jurisdiction’s territory or if they have legal domicile in that jurisdiction for a determined time. Local bids are favoured in the sense that they will succeed even though they are higher than competing non-local bids.
 
National content requirement for renewable energies: In December 2006 the government enacted Law 26190, modified by Law 27191 in September 2015, which established the so-called “National Promotion Regime for the Use of Renewable Energy Sources”. It is applied by the Secretariat of Energy. The Law establishes different benefits, including some fiscal incentives and financial support mechanisms. Among these tools, a preference in the selection of offers in public procurement and a discount in the maintenance cost of the World Bank guarantee.
 
Background
 
The barrier has been in place in different forms for a long time, except in the period between 1991 and 2001. A first ""Buy Argentine"" legislation was applicable until its suspension in 1991. In 2001, the Economic Emergency Law No. 23697 reintroduced a preference in favour of domestic industry for the procurement and contracting of goods, works and services by public entities, with a maximum of 10% domestic preference in the case of goods. This provision was subsequently repealed by Law No. 25551 “Buy Argentine Labour” (“Compre Trabajo Argentino”), which established preferences for goods of domestic origin of 7% (for SMEs) or 5% (for other enterprises). In addition, since 2012 all companies with exporting activities, irrespective of their SME status, were also given a preference margin of 7%. Different preferences for local suppliers were introduced in the tenders for renewable energy launched by the Ministry of Energy (current Secretariat of Energy) since 2016.
 
The new Law Nº 27437 on “Buy Argentina and Development of Suppliers”, published in May 2018, entered into effect three months later on August 8. Its implementing Decree Nº 800/2018 was adopted in September 2018."

11400	False	Active	Chile	"Imports of EU electronic and fuel burning products have to go through a burdensome two-step certification procedure. Certificates or tests carried out in the origin country, although valid in Chile, must be completed with tests in Chile which increase the cost for importing goods. This requirement also applies for products certified in their country of origin by internationally recognised laboratories and which are based on international standards, except if a bilateral agreement with a Chilean laboratory exists.
Any EU laboratory can conclude a such a private bilateral agreement with a laboratory in Chile. These private bilateral agreements are subject to approval by the Chilean competent authority SEC.
These agreements allow companies to use a simpler system (no.2), so that most tests can be carried out in the country of the producer and not each individual batch has to be certified.
However, parties cannot be prevented from unilaterally ending the agreements. Also, some tests still need to be carried out in Chile, even in case of a bilateral agreement between laboratories. (There are only few laboratories in Chile.)
 
Background
Safety requirements for electronic and fuel products published as Chilean regulations (NCh) are based largely on standards of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC standards).
In the case of imports, Decree 298/2005 introduced a so-called ""Special Certification System"", which provides for recognition of foreign certificates issued by foreign conformity assessment bodies (CABs). This system consists of a two-step procedure: (1) a ""Resolution"" issued by the Superintendencia de Electricidad y Combustibles (SEC); and (2) a ""Certificate of Approval"" issued by CABs. Moreover, the system requires additional sample testing of a batch, albeit a simplified testing and not for the whole analysis of a product. Only CABs authorised by SEC can provide certificates of approval.
Chile notified to the WTO amendments to Decree 298/2005 in both 2010 and in 2013 as further modifications were made, to which the EU provided comments at both instances. However, due to the complexity of modernising the bill, the process was suspended in November 2013. Instead, some elements were improved: certificates of conformity no longer require legalisation by the Chilean Consulate in the country of issuance. Another improvement is the possibility to carry out testing by laboratories which are party to the ILAC or IECEE CB schemes. Finally, the Decree mentions the possibility of mutual recognition agreements with third countries, but this option has never been used, nor is it likely to be used in the near future.
There are no plans to review the Decree to allow for self-certification by the manufacturer, nor mutual recognition of self-certification by third countries like the EU, as Chile has been underlining at recent meetings of the TBT committee of the EU-Chile Association Agreement.
The EU conformity assessment procedure for electronic products is less cumbersome, irrespective of whether the manufacturer is located in the EU or abroad. The manufacturer has only to provide a Supplier’s Declaration of Conformity (SDoC), make the technical documentation available and place the ""CE"" marking on the product as proof of compliance with the relevant EC legislation (safety directive for low voltage products (LVD) and the electromagnetic compatibility directive (EMC)). However, in Chile, EU electronic products have to undergo the above mentioned cumbersome procedure that in turn increases the cost for imported goods.

11360	False	Active	Brazil	"Certain measures concerning taxation and charges affect several economic sectors and, in some cases, they apply horizontally to all goods or to broad categories of goods. These measures, taken as a whole and individually, increase the effective level of border protection in Brazil, whilst providing preferences and support to domestic producers and exporters, by inter alia (1) imposing a higher tax burden on imported goods than on domestic goods, (2) conditioning tax advantages to the use of domestic goods, and (3) providing export contingent subsidies. Whereas some of the specific measures at issue have existed for some years, the overall framework of tax advantages to operators in Brazil, in relation to taxation, has been strengthened since September 2012 with the adoption of new specific tax schemes and the revision or completion of existing ones, thus following a consistent pattern.
Several of the main measures have been referred to the WTO in line with the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes. On 19 December 2013, the European Union requested consultations with Brazil. On 31 October 2014, the European Union requested the establishment of a panel. At its meeting on 17 December 2014, the Dispute Settlement Body established a panel. More information is available on the WTO website regarding the dispute settlement case DS472.
On 13 December 2018, the Appellate Body issued its report in the Brazil-Taxation case (DS472/497). The report is now made public on the WTO website. The outcome is an overall victory for the EU.
The Appellate Body confirmed the Panel’s finding that tax programmes put in place by Brazil (INOVAR-AUTO, Informatics Programme, the Digital Inclusion programme, PADIS and PATVD) discriminate against EU automotive and ICT products by granting tax advantages based on the local content embedded in products. The ruling confirms that such localisation policies, which favour domestic goods over imported goods, are illegal under WTO law.
The EU had also challenged two additional programmes (PEC and RECAP) granting tax advantages for exporters in Brazil that met certain export threshold requirements. The Appellate Body did not confirm the ruling of the WTO Panel that the two export programmes are export-performance subsidies prohibited under WTO rules.

11280	False	Active	Mexico	"Excessive document requirements for importers are causing delays and represent a non-tariff barrier. EU companies report that customs procedures are sometimes not transparent nor consistent with the rules stipulated in the EU-Mexico Free Trade Agreement. These issues have been partially addressed in the recent customs reform of 2013 and later during the negotiations of the modernised FTA.
 
Background
Customs procedures in Mexico continue being considered as inefficient mainly because of their complex and irksome technical requirements. A simplification of procedures and reduction of administrative costs would not only facilitate trade, but also release public resources that could be allocated more efficiently elsewhere, such as for security concerns or intellectual property (IP) enforcement.
The Government partially addressed these issues with a customs reform in 2008, as it sought to abolish the estimated price system, cancel the importers’ register, eliminate the need to present a formal certificate of origin for sensitive products and eliminate certain monopolistic measures such as the single channel for imports. Further encouraging steps to facilitate trade were taken in the recent customs reform of 2013, which was published as law in the official gazette on 9 December 2013 and came into effect on 10 December 2013 (Decreto por el que se reforman, adicionan y derogan diversas disposiciones de la Ley Aduanera).
The reform of 2013 aimed to reinforce trade facilitation by creating a customs electronic system, meaning that all import and export customs declarations are now to be filed electronically. Another important and long standing issue, which this reform addressed, was the abolishment of the obligatory use of custom brokers. Importers and exporters are able to carry-out their own customs clearance. As far as risk analysis is concerned, the reform eliminated a second round of customs inspection and established that the customs inspection has to be carried out with the use of non-intrusive technology.
However, concerns remain at certain customs procedures such as the lack of prior notification of procedural changes and inconsistent interpretation of trade requirements at the different ports of entry.
With regard to security issues, the Government has been working on strengthening border control via updates of security control equipment and reinforced cooperation with the US, but customs’ role and capacity in combating illegal trade, notably piracy and counterfeit products remain weak, partly due to the fact that legislation does not grant them ex officio powers."

Unnecessary burdensome certification procedure for ceramic tiles

 
The registration to the SABER system is mandatory since 15th of June 2019 which is unnecessary burdensome and results in high costs for EU producers. Importers have to fill in the information on the imported products, manufacturing facility and shipment through a proforma invoice. The modalities of registrations is not clear as the user guide requires a Commerce Registration number which limits the access to local traders and the possibility that exporters can have access to the system if importers register them as “contact officer” is not acceptable. It is not clear if importers must include the information by model or format, which would multiply the costs for the exporters as they pay per uploaded item and importer, instead of registering product groups only. In addition, the breakdown of products down to 10 digit level of ceramic tiles is applied as opposed to the 6 digit level HS codes currently utilised internationally on ceramic tiles. All these factors increase unnecessary the costs of registration.
 
The exporter has to get more additional information as required by the standardisation authority SASO requires due to technical regulations and product certification schemes which have to be provided through the new program SALEEM. This includes an annual quality and environmental protection auditing with sample testing and documentary verification of the laboratory tests to ensure compliance with the SASO ISO-13006 (product standard). During the factory auditing, the inspectors must select a product sample from each type (group of absorption) and test it in an external certified laboratory (ISO 17067).  The items being audited are very similar to those evaluated by the ISO 9001 and the same as those evaluated by the ISO 14001. These standards regarding quality and environmental protection are voluntary in Europe. This represents an unnecessary requirement, a duplication of efforts and a substantial increase of costs and work. In addition, besides the annual factory auditing and documentary verification, also a pre-shipment certification is required.
 

Burdensome Quality mark

A new measure is foreseen that requires a mandatory Saudi Quality Mark for ceramic tiles by September 2019. The new regulation will significantly increase the costs for EU companies to comply with the Saudi Quality Mark. This is an unnecessary measure for imports. Together with the increased costs and additional work due to the new certification procedure,  imports face an unnecessary complication of procedures and respective costs, which is discriminating imports to local products. In addition, the text of the new technical requirements is not accessible."

Import licenses are denied with the argument of public security, as this chemical could be used for producing explosives. However, Industrial NC is not used for military applications, but for applications like printing inks, wood lacquer or nail varnish. Military nitrocellulose is used for military purposes, but this is a different product with higher nitrogen content. Brazil stated that this issue would be discussed at inter-ministerial meetings in a study-group, but without results since 2011.

PRAs are the main phytosanitary pre-requisite of the competent authority of Brazil - MAPA - to authorise imports into Brazil of plants and their products. Unfortunatly, Brazil did not yet allocate more resources to speed up the PRAs or made them more flexible, e.g. grouping of similar requests.
The European Commission was informed at the end of April 2014 that the Department of Plant Health of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply Agriculture of Brazil (Departamento de Sanidade Vegetal - Secretaria de Defesa Agrosanitária, DSV-SDA-MAPA) requested via the Diário Oficial da União of Brazil of 21 February 2014 (N° 37) trading partners to confirm their interest in exporting plants and plant products which are to be subject to the performance in Brazil of a ""pest risk analyses"" (PRA) - Análise de Risco de Pragas.

12780	False	Active	Indonesia	"a. In 2016, Indonesia adopted Law No. 13 of 2016 on Patents, in which it introduced a local manufacturing requirement. Accordingly, the patent holder shall be obliged to manufacture the patented product or use the patented process in Indonesia. The new Patent Law also lays down that non-compliance with the requirement within 36 months from the grant of the patent triggers the possibility to issue a compulsory license or the abolishment of the patent. The local working requirement discriminates imported patented products against domestically produced goods under patent protection. The related provisions are not compliant with Article 27(1) of the TRIPS Agreement. Article 20 of the 2016 Patent Law requires patent holders to ""manufacture a product or to use a process in Indonesia"" and the requirement is to ""support the transfer of technology, absorption of investment, and/or provision of job opportunities."" The 2016 Patent Law introduced sanction for non-compliance that may lead to revocation of the patent.
b. The Ministry of Law and Human Rights has issued the Ministerial Regulation No. 15 of 2018 on Implementation of Patent by Patent Holder. This regulation is in force with effect from 11 July 2018. It provides that a Patent Holder may submit a request to postpone compliance with Article 20 of the Patent Law, which came into effect in 2016. The application is to be supported by the reasons for the inability to implement the regulation, i.e. the patent holder does not have the capability to practice the patent or it is not economically viable to do so. If the temporary waiver is granted, it will be valid for a maximum period of five years and further requests can be considered. The request for a waiver must be made within three years from granting the patent. The sanction under Article 132 (revocation) for non-compliance with Article 20 will not apply to patents already in force before 2016 because the sanction provision does not have ""retroactive"" effect.
c. The Ministry of Law and Human Rights issued the Ministerial Regulation No. 39 of 2018 on Procedures of Compulsory License to implement Articles No. 81 – 107 of the Patent Law. The regulation states that the Minister may grant a compulsory license if the patent holder does not exercise the mandatory obligation to produce the patented product or use patented process for three years after the patent is issued.

11120	False	Active	Indonesia	"a. Indonesian National Standards (SNIs) and marking requirements- Indonesia applies the Indonesian National Standards (SNI) certification system in a number of sectors and industries, including where internationally accepted standards or certifications are available. The Ministry of Industry has been introducing and enforcing Indonesian mandatory National Standards for an increasing number of products (cosmetics, fertilizers, tyres, automotive parts, electrical cables, baby clothing, ceramic tiles, toys, etc) and often at a short notice. Indonesia does not accept foreign companies to certify compliance with particular ISO standard, even if these companies are accredited by international agencies that are members of ILAC and other international bodies. Instead, Indonesia imposes specific testing carried out by companies recognized by Indonesia, duplicating procedures and creating a burdensome and costly process. Compliance with SNIs is verified by means of complex third party conformity assessment procedures. The EU also has strong concerns about the pre-market authorization system (certification and testing process).
In particular, Ministry of Industry (MOI) Regulation 24/2013, as amended by Regulation 55/2013, on Compulsory Indonesian National Standards (SNI) on Toys requires, as of April 2016, a mutual recognition agreement for the acceptance of test reports from laboratories outside Indonesia. The EU is not aware of any existing mutual recognition agreements. Imports from the EU are subject to mandatory in-country testing in Indonesia to obtain certification under SNI for import.
Based on Ministry of Trade Regulation 73/2015, Indonesia requires stakeholders to strictly apply specific, individual marking requirements for textile based products, tableware and plastic household products. Alternative ways are not accepted.
b. Industry Law (Law 3/2014) and Standardization Law (Law 20/2014), complemented by the Government Regulation 201/2000 on the National Standardisation, and the Head of National Standardisation Agency (BSN) Regulation 135/2010 on the National Standardisation System, are potentially trade restrictive, in terms of the strict use of national standards and preference given to local products.
c. The Halal Law 33/2014 sets out a broad and restrictive regime on halal products. The EU has been closely monitoring the situation to avoid bringing trade to a halt. As of September 2019, implementing rules are still unclear. The Government Regulation (Peraturan Pemerintah) PP No. 31/2019 on the Implementation of the Law No. 33 of 2014 on Halal Product Assurance, has been applied since 3 May 2019. The first stage of compulsory halal certification covers food and beverage products, starting from 17 October 2019 and ending on 17 October 2024. After 17 October 2024, all food and beverage products should already have obtained the halal certification.

Most retail operators to source 80% of their products locally;
Priority for local materials and components and requires defence users to use locally produced defence and security tools whenever available (up to 85%);
Foreign companies to have a joint operation with local companies; increased use of domestic products across all sectors, especially when using state controlled resources;
Local content requirements for power plants and transmission towers and solar panels; fairly stringent local content requirements for Long-Term Evolution (LTE) telecom towers, LTE-based standard of telecommunication devices and/or equipment;
Local content for mobile devices;
Local content for electronic devices;
Exports of coal and crude palm oil and imports of rice and government procurement goods have to use national shipping lines and national insurance. With regard to maritime transport, the regulation was reported to enter into force for a trial period on 1 February 2019; mandatory conditions for maritime cargo insurance are applied from 1 March 2019; the shipping requirement would enter into force on 1 May 2020.
In an attempt to boost the development of the local pharmaceutical industry Indonesia introduced 25% Local Content Requirements for raw materials for pharmaceuticals (Presidential Instruction 6/2016 5 and 6), ignoring the fact that over 95% of active pharmaceutical ingredients in Indonesia are still imported and that the domestic environment is not conducive to attract R&D investment. (See also barrier 12780 on domestic manufacturing requirements for patented products).

b) Government procurement: Indonesian legislation mandates the use of domestic products in government procurement in key sectors. Furthermore, Presidential Regulation n. 54/2010 as amended (lastly by Presidential Reg. No 18/2018) foresees significant additional restrictions to foreign companies, i.e. forced partnership with local companies, increased local content requirements, and substantially higher threshold for foreign companies to participate in tenders (for construction services the new threshold is IDR 1 trillion from previously IDR 100 billion, for consultancy services IDR 25 billion from IDR 10 billion, and for goods and services IDR 50 billion from IDR 20 billion).
The regulation requires procuring entities to seek maximum local content, use foreign components only when necessary, and designate foreign contractors as sub-contractors to local companies. Articles 66 and 67 (preferences for domestic products) make locally produced goods and services mandatory for use in procurements from all relevant ministries, institutions and regional governments. Local goods or services are defined to be those where at least 40 percent of the total value is comprised of local components or inputs. Foreign goods and services are permitted only when not available locally, and/or domestic production volume is not capable of meeting necessary demand.

Trade Law (Law 7/2014) and Industry Law (Law 3/2014) foresee strong supervision and control of the circulation of goods and confer powers to the Government to introduce restrictions on imports based on national interests. The definition of national interests is vague. The state of play of the implementation of these Laws is unclear.
Non-automatic import licensing, pre-shipment controls and customs procedures (including sampling and testing procedures) hamper trade. In some cases, this situation adds up to tariff peaks or changing customs duties - which, although in compliance with WTO law, further hamper market access. Several regulations, namely the Ministry of Trade Regulation 27/2012 (amended by Regulations 59/2012, 84/2012 and 70/2015) and regulation 83/2012 (replaced by Regulations 61/2013, 87/2015, 94/2015 and 81/2017) covering pre-shipment controls and entry port restrictions for more than 800 products, create a complex, non-transparent and burdensome non-automatic import licensing system. This system can result in de facto quantitative restrictions, for instance on alcoholic beverages, which are also subject to fiscal discrimination. Decree 53/2018 of the Ministry of Agriculture sets out the obligation for fresh horticultural products to obtain a registration number from January 2020.
Law No. 13/2010 on Horticulture and the Law No. 18/2012 on Food, foresee the possibility to restrict imports of all kinds of food products, including seeds. It results in complex import processes, requiring several permits from different institutions and compliance with various standards. (See Key Barrier 10600)

SPECIFIC

Regulation 77/2016 reintroduced import restrictions on tyres, which had been successfully removed in 2015. It restricts imports in order “to support the availability and supply of domestic tyres, to support national tyres industries development, to create fair competition, and to increase national competitiveness.” The Regulation includes provisions obliging distributors/importers to import through bonded logistic centres. It mandates an additional layer of import procedures and limits the availability of bonded warehouses, generating significant additional costs.
Indonesia's iron and steel import restrictions affect the automotive sector’s ability to have access to replacement parts. Cumbersome procedures apply to obtain exemptions. Ministry of Trade Regulation No. 110 of 2018 on Import Provision of Iron and Steel, Alloy Steel and Its Derivatives also imposes import through bonded logistic centres. The regulation no longer provides exemption from the requirement for import approval of iron less than 1 metric ton.
On alcoholic beverages, in addition to very high import tariffs with imported spirits being subject to a 150% and wines to a 90% import customs duty,  Indonesia applies high and discriminatory excise duties. Since January 2019, de jure quantitative restrictions have been removed and a new annual forecast and distribution plan has replaced them. Though improved, the system may still limit importations, de facto, by disadvantaging those importers who ask for a large import volume, since they have to pay in advance the full amount of the import duty corresponding to the volume on the import license but may be penalised if eventual sales are lower.
On agricultural products, the Government Decree No. 35/2016 on Types and Tariffs of Non-Tax State Revenues sets out tariff categories for services provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and generates high costs for inspection/audit services on establishments exporting animals, animal products and veterinary drugs to Indonesia. Audits are to be carried out in the companies' countries of origin. Though some Member States establishments have applied for recognition inspection even prior to the issuance of the decree in August 2016, they are now subject to new fees (see also under Food and Agricultural products, including SPS issues).
On chemical products, on April 13, 2018, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry released a list containing 3.887 chemicals: 134 categorized as banned, 2.071 categorize as restricted and 1.682 chemicals categorized as free to use. The background criteria that were used for the categorization are unclear.

b) The Trade Law (7/2014) confers powers to the Government to introduce export restrictions, if justified on national interests and to safeguard national resources. This concerns especially the exports of basic commodities, such as oil, gas and minerals.
c) Mining sector restrictions - Regulations 7/2012, 11/2012 and 20/2013 banned exports of unprocessed mineral and metal ores, except coal, with the objective to increase local value-added of minerals through processing and refining. Regulation 1/2017 allowed exports of unprocessed and semi- processed mineral ores until 2022. However, the relaxation requires the exporting company to build smelters within five years and convert their Contract of Work scheme into Special Mining Business License (with less investment protection and uncertain tax regime). Foreign miners must also gradually divest their shares up to 51% to a local entity after 10 years of production in order to extend their export permits. In parallel, a progressive export tax scheme from 20-25% in 2014 to 60% in 2016 on 65 mineral categories was introduced.
On 30 August 2019, in a move to secure supply for domestic smelters and support a national programme on electric vehicle, the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources issued Regulation 11/2019 to bring forward the implementation of the export ban on nickel ores to 1 January 2020, two years ahead of the initial plan. Indonesia is a key global supplier of important metals such as nickel, copper and bauxite. While EU nickel imports from Indonesia are limited, the restrictions are having indirect economic effects on globally traded raw materials as well as on the EU industry.
b) Mining sector restrictions - On January 2014 Indonesia implemented export restriction to all raw mineral ores (11 metals, 8 non-metal minerals, and 19 stones) in an effort to develop the downstream industry of the sector, as mandated by the Law No 4 of 2009 on Mineral and Coal Mining. The full ban was planned to be implemented in 12 January 2017. As implementing regulations, Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources issued Regulations 7/2012, 11/2012 and 20/2013 on guidelines to increase local value-added of minerals through processing and refining. Furthermore a progressive export tax scheme from 20-25% in 2014 to 60% in 2016 on 65 mineral categories was introduced.
However, on 11 January 2017, the Indonesian government issued Government Regulation No 1/2017 which allowed companies to continue exporting unprocessed and semi-processed mineral ores, previously subject to full ban starting from 12 January 2017 mentioned above. Subsequently, as implementing regulations, the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources issued Regulation No 5/2017, No 6/2017, No 7/2017, No 9/2017, and No 15/2017 to stipulate the technicalities.
The current regime stipulates that holders of Contract of Works (CoW), Operation Production Mining Licenses (OPIUPs) and Special Mining Business Licenses (IUPKs), producing concentrate forms of copper, nickel ore, and certain other metals, will be allowed to continue to export their concentrate and ore products, in quantities approved by the Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources, for a maximum of five years from 11 January 2017 as long as they:

In the case of CoW holders, convert the CoW status to Izin Usaha Pertambangan Khusus (Special Mining Business Licence – IUPKs), with less investment protection
in the case of foreign-owned OPIUPs and IUPK holders, commit to divesting 51% of their issued shares to local parties within ten years of commencing production;
commit to constructing domestic smelters within five years;
have their smelter construction plans independently verified and approved by MEMR;
make 90% ongoing progress in fulfilling their commitment to domestic smelter construction;
renew their export permits every twelve months;
for nickel ores producers, collectively supply 30% of the low nickel content ore required by domestic smelters; and
pay the applicable export tax of up to 10% (stipulated by Minister of Finance Regulation No 13/2017)

Indonesia is a key global supplier of important metals such as nickel, copper and bauxite. While the EU imports from Indonesia were limited, indirect economic effects on the EU are likely to result from the impact of the restrictions on globally traded raw materials. In addition the EU is concerned by the systemic effect of a ban on export, one of the most extreme and damaging restrictions, setting a very damaging precedent in a time of resource nationalism.

12300	False	Active	South Africa	"South Africa through its Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP) identifies local content as a strategic industrial policy instrument, which can be used to leverage the power of public procurement; reduce the country’s trade deficit; address market failures; foster infant industries; and increase the governments tax base (the DTI, 2016).
The Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act of 2000 (PPPFA) prescribes the framework within which preferential procurement policies may be implemented as a means of addressing discriminatory policies and practices under the public procurement system. Recent policy developments have been aimed at placing greater reliance on public procurement as a tool for achieving economic transformation.
The Preferential Procurement Regulations of 2017 (previous one from 2011) introduced in April 2017 a number of significant changes which complicate foreign bidders ability to be compliant and competitive. Local Content Regulations, which came into effect on 7 December 2011, are still applicable in the 2017 Public Procurement Regulations, though the sectors affected have increased as the government is increasingly ambitious with its overall target now set to 75% local content.

The DTI may, in consultation with Treasury, designate a sector for local content as well as a minimum threshold.

The following sectors and products have been designated thus far to a minimum threshold ranging from 30% to 100%: rail rolling stock, bus bodies, canned/processed vegetables, textile, clothing, leather and footwear sector, solar water heaters, set-top boxes, certain pharmaceuticals products, furniture products, electrical and telecom cables, valves products and actuators, working vessels, residential electricity meters, steel conveyance pipes, powerline hardware and structures and transformers. The following sectors have been recently approved bringing the number to 23: building and construction materials, yellow metals, two way radios, solar PV components and rail signalling system.

If there is no designated sector, an organ of state may still include, as a specific condition of the tender, that only locally produced services or goods or locally manufactured goods with a stipulated minimum threshold for local production and content, will be considered (in consultation with Treasury).
The regulations give government the power to apply 'pre-qualification criteria to advance certain designated groups' in awarding state tenders. Regulation 4 permits an organ of state to advertise any invitation to tender on the condition that only a particular category of bidders may tender, categories including those having 'stipulated minimum B-BBEE status level', exempted micro enterprises (EME) and qualifying small business enterprises (QSE's) and bidders agreeing to contract a minimum of 30% to various categories of EMEs and QSEs.
A change in the threshold of the evaluation bid on the basis of price and preference (socio economic advancement) whereby tenders are assessed on the basis that, in contracts with a value of equal or above 30 000 rands and up to 50 million rand (the previous threshold was 1 million rand), price shall count for 80 points and preference for 20 points. And in contracts with a value of more than 50 million rand, it would be a 90/10 split.
Organs of state are required to identify tenders, where if feasible, in which, the successful bidder must subcontract a minimum of 30 percent of the contract value for contracts above 30 million rand to advance exempt micro-enterprises and qualifying small enterprises with at least 51% black ownership/youth/women/disabilities.

The Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Programme (REIPPP), which has seen strong participation from the European companies, has stand-alone rules for local procurement. The bids are scored on a 70/30 basis for price and economic development. The minimum threshold for local content reached 45% in the latest round with the target being 60%.
Local content requirements also feature strongly in the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) legislation. The new B-BBEE Codes of Good Practice of 2015 have to be complied with for any economic activity with the public institution or entity. The Codes emphasize 'Enterprise and Supplier Development' as one of the five elements of B-BBEE. This element counts for 40 out of the 109 points on the B-BBEE scorecard and has the following three sub-elements: i) preferential procurement; ii) supplier development (existing suppliers); and iii) enterprise development (new entrants). Supplier and enterprise development can only be done for 51% or more black-owned existing businesses.  Private procurement in the key economic sectors might also become subject to local content requirements. For example, the new Mining Charter (27 September 2018 in force since March 2019) contemplates that 70% of all goods and 80% of services required by holders of mining rights must be procured from local manufactures who must also comply with the B-BBEE regulations.

1) International tendering is only allowed when goods and services are not available locally or local companies do not have the necessary expertise and capacity AND a joint venture is not possible, and in most cases, foreign suppliers require a local partner/intermediary to be permitted to tender.

International tenderers are required to provide a tender deposit whereas local companies are exempted. Performance bonds are required over a certain threshold and must be obtained from domestic financial institutions.

10982	False	Active	Brazil	"The ""Buy Brazil act"" law 12.349/10 of 15 December 2010 amended federal laws of public procurement at the federal, state and municipal levels as well as for public entities. It brought about the introduction of price preferences of up to 25% to bidders that produce in Brazil and that fulfil certain economic requirements. This came on top of already existing irritants such as the obligation for foreign companies to be legally established in Brazil to take part in national tendering. Furthermore, a range of local content requirements is enforced in concessions, public works and other contracts from the State or State-controlled enterprises.
Being the Brazilian public sector the largest buyer of goods and services in the country, discriminatory government procurement policies are a substantial barrier to EU exports.
Background
The Federal Constitution establishes as a general rule that public procurement must be preceded by a public tender, subject to certain exceptions. The general rules for tendering procedures are defined in the following federal laws:

Law 8666/93 (amended by Law 12.349/2010) for administrative contracts for the supply of goods and services,
Law 8987/95 for public services provided through concessions or permissions and
Law 11079/04 for services provided through public-private partnerships.

 
Sub-federal governments and state-owned enterprises can have specific rules for their tendering procedures, provided that they do not conflict with the federal legislation. In 19 July 2010, the Brazilian government amended Law No 8666/1993 with a provisional measure (later converted into Law 12349/2010, the so called ""Buy Brazil Act. This protectionist law introduced price preferences of up to 25% for Brazilian domestic products and services under specific conditions with the justification of achieving economic growth, national technological innovation and employment. The conditions relate to national manufactured products and services that meet the Brazilian technical standards, or alternatively, to specific R&D activities performed in Brazil by the tenderers.
The sectors and the margins of preference are determined by an inter-ministerial commission (Inter-ministerial Commission for Public Procurement, CICP) based on economic studies of the developmental impact of the sectors in question, namely taking into account criteria such as job creation and income generation, effect on tax revenues and development and technological innovation made in Brazil. However, the government can disregard these preferences if there is no local production or capacity to provide the services in Brazil.
Law 12.349/10 does not exclude possible joint ventures or partnerships between foreign and Brazilian companies and extends the preferences to international companies from countries which have signed agreements on public procurement with Brazil, which includes so far Peru and other Mercosur countries.
In addition to allowing for price preferences in certain sectors, the Buy Brazilian Act also allows to restrict procurement contracts in the ICT sectors considered as sensitive or strategic to goods and services developed and produced in Brazil.
This came on top of already existing irritants for EU companies. For participating in national tendering, foreign companies have to set up a Brazilian company and to invest directly in the country to produce goods or services according to the Basic Productive Process (PPB - “processo produtivo básico”). PPB criteria are established by inter-ministerial decrees signed by the Ministers in charge of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade (MDIC) and of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI). Finally, foreign bidders, when participating in consortium with local Brazilian companies, the leader will be the Brazilian partner.

Government agencies and related entities are required to purchase equipment and technology from Chinese state or privately owned manufacturing companies. There is limited access to public tenders and insufficient publicity of all public tenders. This barrier is related to the enforcement of the Government Procurement Law (GPL) adopted on 29 June 2002. Central and local entities tend to implement in a very broad manner those provisions, going far beyond discriminations imposed by the law. In addition, China does not yet undertake any substantial multilateral or bilateral commitment concerning government procurement. It submitted its WTO GPA (Government Procurement Agreement) initial offer end of December 2007, a revised offer in July 2010, second revised offer in November 2011etc. and most recently a fifth revised offer tabled in December 2014. However, despite important progress made the most recent offer is as regards the coverage still far from responding to EU expectations in terms of coverage.
Another issue with wide repercussions on the public procurement field is the implementation of the accreditation procedure for the indigenous innovative procurement scheme. A joint Circular of MOF, MOST and NDRC was issued in September 2009, detailing accreditation procedures to be followed in order to be eligible to tendering procedures. Among the requirements, IPR had to have Chinese origin (e.g. separate existence of brands and the obligation to have R&D related to the IP included in the products located in China), requirement to disclose information related to innovation and IPR, thus exceeding by far standard demands for eligibility to government schemes. A notice issued by the State Council in November 2011, directing all government entitites to remove any mention of linkage between indigenous innovation policy and government procurement incentive measures within regulatory documents and to stop such implementation by 1st December 2011.

11190	False	Active	United States of America	"Overview

The EU and US are both signatories to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (""GPA""). GPA is currently the only legal instrument  which includes legal commitments from the US regarding the access of EU suppliers/service providers and their supplies and services to the US government procurement market.
GPA imposes a non-discrimination and transparency obligation. However, the obligations of the GPA apply only to the specific entities and sectors covered.
The US GPA commitments are limited by way of various derogations. Also, only 37 States are committed to the GPA and with a limited scope. The broadest exemptions to the scope of the GPA concern the Buy American restrictions linked to Federal funding of procurement in specific areas as well as the broad set-asides for US small and medium sized enterprises.
Regional or local US authorities and most other sub-central entities within US States have no legal obligation to treat bids from European companies on an equal footing with US companies.
Many barriers have been erected against foreign bidders in the US procurement market and European companies currently face many obstacles that either prevent or significantly reduce their chances of winning government contracts in the US.
The most important obstacles that European companies typically encounter both with respect to the US Federal Government as well as in US States are for example:
Various types of ""Buy American"" restrictions: The US law allows government offices to require the use of American and local goods, services, suppliers and service providers or at least give them special favourable consideration. As a result, when European companies bid for government contracts, their bids may be subject to discriminatory treatment or even find it excluded from consideration. because the US law allows government offices to require use of American and local goods, services, suppliers and service providers or at least give them special favourable consideration.
US SME preference policy, which reserves about 23% of the value of US government contracts to US SMEs.
Large share of procuring entities within US States are not covered by any commitments and they are therefore not obliged to treat EU bidders on the same footing as US companies for procurement.
Lack of transparency: It is not easy to find proper and timely information on government procurement opportunities in the US at sub-federal level. There is no general access point (apart from the Federal tenders) to information on opportunities to bid for government contracts and the information provided is often unclear.

 
US Federal Government level

The US Federal Government applies a Buy American policy on Federal procurement (contracts which the Federal agencies conclude) and also on procurement which the Federal Government funds within the States (contracts concluded with Federal money).
Some US Federal agencies (such as the Federal Aviation Administration), are still obliged to discriminate against EU businesses on the basis of the 1933 ""Buy American Act"".
In addition, restrictions based on the so called ""Berry Amendment"" establish that only US-products (including procurement of ""non-war"" material such as textiles) can be procured by the US Department of Defense.
Furthermore, Federal agencies apply a mandatory set-aside for US SMEs for 23 % of the value of Federal procurement. EU companies cannot bid for those contracts unless they fulfil the requirements such as to be established and pay taxes in the US and employ US labour.
US also exclude EU suppliers in procurement of for instance ""dredging services"" under the GPA. EU companies do therefore not have access to these contracts at US ports. The background for this restriction is with the ""Jones Act"", which prohibits the use of foreign made dredgers.
""Buy America"" restrictions:

One of the most fundamental obstacles for access to US procurement is a result of the ""Buy America Act"", which is a provision of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 and applies to mass-transit related procurement. Restrictions concern procurement funded by the US Federal Government's Department of Transportation (Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Federal Railroad Administration and Federal Aviation Administration).
The actual procurement contracts are concluded by States or entities within States, such as cities. On the basis of Buy America-restrictions, the Federal Government imposes US content requirements on procurement (that can go up to 100 %). These domestic content restrictions have been carved out from the scope of GPA commitments. The restrictions are effectively enforced as the sub-central recipient is bound to respect the funding conditions containing a Buy America obligation.
Consequently, if a European bidder wants to tender for procurement contracts using Federal funds for example in a project to build new railway infrastructure, it must prove that it uses steel, iron and manufactured products produced in the US instead of using steel or products manufactured in Europe.


Buy America type of provisions have become a regular feature of bills funding Federal grants to the states, municipal or transit authorities. Restrictions have also extended to areas outside of transportation, such as environmental infrastructure projects. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) adopted in 2014, which imposed new and permanent Buy America restrictions on procurements funded by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Clean Water infrastructure fund.
The US Federal Government continues to introduce new laws or budget appropriations which either extend the scope of existing Buy America restrictions or impose new ones. One of the most recent legislative amendments by the US Federal Government adding stricter Buy America rules is the “Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act” (FAST Act). The FAST Act, which President Obama signed on December 4, 2015, reauthorizes surface transportation programs through fiscal year 2020. In doing so, it increases the domestic content requirements for rolling stock (such as buses) from the current 60% of the cost of all components to 65% for fiscal years 2018-19 and to 70%, beginning in FY 2020. The DOT’s Federal Transit Administration, which provides funding to local public transit systems, including buses, subways, light rail, commuter rail, trolleys and ferries, will implement the new requirements. The FAST Act also tightens the waiver process applied by the Federal Transit Administration.


It should also be noted that in order to be able to bid for contracts by Federal agencies, it is necessary to register with the System for Award Management (SAM).  

 
US State level procurement

The commitments made by the US at State level under the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) are limited in scope. Furthermore, the States' legal framework in procurement is very fragmented, which causes de factor barriers. Each of the US States has their own laws and they apply various levels of their own “Buy American” requirements giving favourable treatment to products which have been manufactured in the US. In particular, 27 States impose obligations within state-law to give favourable treatment to ""American made products"". Furthermore, some States impose obligations to favour US manufactured products when local entities use State-funds. These impose obligations to supply US manufactured products.
In addition, many States also impose preferences which give favourable treatment to products manufactured within a specific State. On top of State-law based preferences, additional requirements are applied for example by many US cities. Finally, many US States apply specific set-asides for US SMEs established within their respective State.


With regard to US States, only specific entities of 37 States out of the 50 US States have to follow the GPA rules, such as non-discrimination with respect to EU businesses. These are typically entities of State Government while for example cities are not covered by the GPA obligations. A majority of procuring entities within US States are not obliged to treat EU bidders on the same footing as US companies. A majority of procuring entities within US States are not obliged to treat EU bidders on the same footing as US companies. An example of an explicit exclusion from the scope of commitments is the procurement of vehicles by the States of Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New York, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Wyoming.
Also States have a trend of imposing new and additional Buy America-restrictions. Recently both New Jersey and New York proposed to introduce new Buy America-laws. These legislative bills were, however, withdrawn at last stage.


The lack of easy access to information on procurement opportunities in the US States is a key deterrent to participate in US procurement. EU businesses can bid for contracts only if they are able to find information on them. EU companies need to navigate through hundreds of different procurement portals and suffer from various obstacles to register as bidders. In many States, in order to receive information on contracts and in order to bid, companies first have to register with the State. For this each State applies its own requirements. Some States require a payment to register as a bidder. Registration requirements act as further market access obstacles.

 
Latest Developments

President Trump signed an Executive Order on 18 April 2017 on ""Buy American and Hire American"". The main focus of this Order is that i) the Federal Government should maximise the use of American made goods; and ii) the enforcement and monitoring of Buy American (BA) should be enforced.
The Executive Order requested the Department of Commerce and USTR to carry out an assessment with respect to US FTAs on procurement and the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA). The final report of this assessment was due to be submitted to the President by 24 November 2017. Its conclusions and recommendations were political were not made public.


A possible extension of Buy American rules would have a negative impact on international trade and investment. In general, this kind of policy reduces competition, raises the price of goods and services and is costly to taxpayers. Further restricting access to the US market would also carry the risk that other countries would emulate the US.


There is also concern that the developments in the US may raise issues of compatibility with US obligations in the GPA. The EU expects the US to uphold those commitments. The EU continues closely following up on this process.  and reacted at appropriate levels. Following the request of the EU, a dedicated discussion was therefore organized also at the  GPA Committee in Geneva 16-18 October. The US replied that they are committed to respect their GPA obligations.


At Federal level one significant legislative amendment has been adopted: Increase to the U.S. Simplified Acquisition Threshold from US$150K to US$250K (exception under US GPA commitments). This means that from January 2018 foreign companies will in practice be excluded from U.S. federal contracts under US$250,000.


On 31 January 2019 President Trump signed an Executive Order “to strengthen Buy-American principles in Federal financial assistance programs” (the “EO”).  The new EO builds on the policy in the president’s Executive Order of 17 April 2017 “Buy American, Hire American order”, to maximize the use of US goods, products and materials in federal procurements. The EO recommended, but did not outright require, to expand Buy American to the use of Federal financial assistance. Through the EO the president directed the heads of federal departments and agencies that administer programs that provide financial assistance for infrastructure projects to “encourage” recipients of such assistance to use U.S.-produced iron and aluminium and other manufactured US products “to the greatest extent practicable” in the projects. The new requirement became effective at the beginning of May. The January EO also directed the agency heads, within 120 days, to prepare reports on maximizing the use of American-made iron, aluminium and manufactured products in infrastructure projects, including whether the “encouragement” provision should become a mandate. The EO was not to be “construed to impair or otherwise affect existing rights or obligations under international agreements”.


On 15 July 2019 President Trump issued another Buy American EO, aimed at maximizing purchases by federal agencies of US goods, products and materials with the aim of: i) reducing the amount of foreign content that can be included in a product that is considered American-made under the Buy American Act of 1933 (BAA) and ii) restricting the ability of federal agencies to purchase foreign products. The BAA establishes a preference for US made products and construction materials, provided that the purchase is consistent with the public interest and the items are reasonable in cost. The president directed the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) to “consider proposing for notice and public comment” changes to federal regulations within 180 days of the EO date.
First, the EO proposed a change in determinations of what products are considered to be of foreign origin.  Currently, a product is considered ""domestic"" if more than 50% of the components (by cost) are of US origin. The Executive Order proposes to increase to 55% the US content required. In addition, the EO would like the FAR to be amended so as to include a new requirement that requires iron and steel products to have 95% of US content (by cost) to be able to qualify of ""domestic"" origin.
Second, the EO proposes changes to the price adjustments that allow US federal entities to apply exceptions to the BAA in order to purchase non-domestic products. While the BAA does not prohibit the purchase of foreign products per se. It gives a price penalty to the foreign offer for purposes of evaluating and comparing domestic versus foreign offers. One of the most widely used exceptions to the BAA is when the domestic end product is considered to be ""unreasonably"" more expensive than the foreign product. In that case, for the purpose of comparing the price of the various offers when the cheapest one is not the domestic product, the cost of the evaluated foreign product is inflated by 6% if the domestic offer is from a large business or by 12% if it is from a small business. The Executive Order proposes to increase those evaluation preferences to 20 and 30% respectively.

Before that, the preference margin was 15%. Furthermore, there was no requirement for a majority of Algerian capital for Algerian companies, and it only applied to international tenders.
The article penalizes foreign companies that already existed in Algeria, even for national tenders. The same decree, modified on February 2013, establishes that the foreign bidder must invest in the same activity sector via the creation of a company mainly owned by Algerian partners.  The Regulation does not establish amounts or percentages in the contract, as it only refers to an up to 20% penalty if this requirement is breached, and it does not specify any period of time to materialize the investment.
The obligation to invest refers to any public contract, even goods supply, and does not exempt foreign companies that had previously invested in the country. Meanwhile, no investment is required for local bidders.
More recently, upon the publication of a ministerial instruction in September 2017, Algeria’s Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia stated he would personally examine and decide every award for national tenders with international companies.

According to the information received from DG AGRI, the labels will be made by a company which is in a situation of monopoly. The COM has sent comments via the TBT channel (TBT-G/TBT/N/TUR/45) on 24 July 2014.

11220	False	Active	Turkey	"1) Ad-valorem taxation on spirits was fully eliminated by a Turkish government decree adopted on 6 April 2009 and new specific duty rates, in line with the EU acquis, were introduced. However, these rates discriminated in favour of domestically produced raki and against types of spirits primarily imported from the EU (e.g. whisky and rum). Then, in the framework of the negotiations to open chapter 16 – Taxation, Turkey adopted an Action Plan on 18 May 2009, setting clear milestones with a view to the full gradual elimination of discriminatory taxation on spirituous beverages and imported tobacco. Since then, Turkey has introduced successive across the board excise tax increases, where the same percentage increase was applied to each category of spirits. This was not in accordance with the Turkish Action Plan. This barrier was qualified as ""key"" barrier during the update of the key barriers list in February 2014.
2) Turkey previously required two certificates for importation from the EU – the Certificate of Conformity for Importation (CCI) required by the Tobacco Board and the Control Certificate (CC) required by the Ministry of Agriculture. However, the CCI requirement was abolished in 2008 and the brand-specific import permit - the Control Certificate - at the end of 2011. Currently we monitor the pre-notification regime which is now in place. This barrier is not a key barrier.
3) In September 2013, Turkey introduced a new product verification and tracking label for food stuffs, including alcoholic beverages, without properly notifying this, either under the TRIS or under the WTO TBT Agreement. We were informed that Turkey has revised its legislation so that alcoholic beverages will no longer be included.
4) We are informed that the Turkish customs authorities are carrying out excessive sampling controls whereby, generally, at least 2 bottles are removed for analysis, on each depletion of stock from bonded warehouses. Turkey has put in place an inspection regime and if companies apply for and submit to an authorisation check, the level of sampling can be reduced from 100% to 10%. Since the EU has stringent controls on safety standards for alcoholic beverages and we have a Customs Union with free movement of goods, such sampling controls in Turkey should not be necessary. This barrier was qualified as ""key"" barrier during the update of the key barriers list in February 2014.
5). Legislation on warning messages placed on containers of alcoholic beverages and procedures and principles concerning domestic and foreign trading of alcoholic beverages.In mid-2013, the Turkish government enacted legislation imposing a range of restrictions, including: (a) a ban on advertising and promotion of alcoholic beverages and to restrict on- and off-trade premises close to places of worship or education; and (b) to require all alcoholic beverages to carry health warnings.The legislation requires all alcoholic beverages to show 3 logos, targeted at minors, pregnant women and drivers, with an additional message which translates as ‘alcohol is not your friend’.In addition, EU brewers that normally use a uniform mark for their entire product range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, may not be able to sell their alcohol-free beer in Turkey, if the variant containing alcohol is already on the Turkish market and vice-versa.This barrier is not a key barrier.
6). The appointment of a new operating company for the product-tracking system under the Ministry of Finance and the possible introduction of a new strip stamp system for alcoholic beverages in Turkey has been pending for more than a year. With regard to beer, the unit price for coded labels for imported bottled or canned beers, applied in foreign production facilities (including bonded warehouses and free zones) by the importers’ own capabilities is higher than the equivalent unit price for locally produced bottled or canned beers applied on serial production lines by the producers themselves in their own facilities. Turkey has indicated that the discrimination was removed. This barrier was qualified as ""key"" barrier during the update of the key barriers list in February 2014."

Date and reference of the domestic legal act imposing the contested measure:

New circular, amending Note n°1818/DGD/SP/D012/2017 of 7 November 2017 and imposed as of 20th May 2018.

 Factual description of the measure:

Algerian Custom authorities will choose, on a random basis, the dryports where ships are directed to discharge goods in the port of Algiers.
European shipping companies are heavily affected by this new provision. The circular is causing them serious operational, legal and financial issues.
Operational issues:
The criterion being used to allocate goods in dry ports (the availability of storage space) appears inadequate. In the absence of an efficient common system linking Algerian customs to Off-Dock Container Yards (ODCYs), it seems technically challenging to obtain reliable real-time information. Besides, the truck capacity deployed to handle the cargo from the port centre to the imposed ODCY is unknown.
Moreover, the imposed ODCY may not be equipped to receive certain cargo (hazardous, reefer, LCL containers). Under these conditions, shipping companies may be forced to delay the delivery of such goods.
Additionally, the tracking of cargo between the port of unloading and the imposed ODCY will be made difficult. To-date, it remains unclear how recipients will be informed of the final location of their cargo. This last minute-allocation induces delays, additional and unnecessary costs.
These measures are hampering operations and worsening the congestion in the port of Algiers where the circular applies, besides being detrimental to the Algerian customers and European exporters. Some of them have already refused to load until the situation is back to normal.
Legal issues:
The absence of a legal and contractual framework between the shipping companies and ODCYs is problematic. For instance, the circular does not specify who is legally responsible for transporting cargo from the port of unloading to the dry port, nor does it address the issue of liability in case of an accident during the journey.
In addition, the existing agreements between receiver customers and the dry port managers (regarding for example “free time” that has to do with storage in dry port) will no longer apply. This will cause legal uncertainty and confusion.
Furthermore, the circular is posing concerns in terms of competition law, by unduly favouring national dry ports, to the detriment of privately foreign-owned facilities. European shipping companies feel that this discriminatory treatment is unjustified.

Product affected: 020714 (FROZEN CUTS AND EDIBLE OFFAL OF FOWLS OF THE SPECIES GALLUS DOMESTICUS).
In 2015, South Africa imposed anti-dumping duties of 22%, 30% and 73% on imports respectively from NL, UK and DE, based on the SA's anti-dumping regulatory framework which is in line with the WTO anti-dumping agreement.
These measures normally expire after 5 years unless, in the meantime, an interim investigation is opened based on new elements, or a sun-set investigation is granted at the end of the 5 years to renew the measures. To our knowledge, the Southern African Poultry Association has made a submission to renew the measures for another five years.
On top of the anti-dumping measures, on 15 December 2016 a provisional safeguard measure of 13.9% was imposed on imports from the whole EU based on Article 34 of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between the EU and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). In line with this Article, these measures expired on 3 July 2017 (provisional measures can stay in force only for 200 days) and the safeguard investigation was concluded in September 2017 by ITAC (the International Trade Administration of South Africa), the competent authority. According to South Africa's internal rules, ITAC made then a recommendation deciding to inform the Minister of Trade and Industry that there is sufficient information to justify that the matter be raised in the Trade and Development Committee (as required by EPA Article 34.7).
On 28 September 2018, a final safeguard measure of 35.3% was adopted by the Southern African Customs Union, comprising Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and South Africa.

13982	False	Active	United States of America	"President Trump signed on 22 December 2017 a major revision of the US tax system with the ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" (TCJA). In addition to lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, the TCJA substantially changed the manner in which the United States taxes international income.  Proposed regulations implementing these changes were issued on 10 October 2018, 21 December 2018 and 6 March 2019.
A specific fiscal incentive, the foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) tax deduction, bestows a fiscal incentive to exports. Specifically, a special tax deduction is linked to US exports of many goods and services, and the amount of the benefit depends on export performance. Given its design and effect, this tax deduction is a measure that would most likely qualify as a prohibited export subsidy under the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. It is estimated that this new export subsidy grants a financial benefit of around $20 billion annually to US corporations. Based on the design of the export subsidy, the main beneficiary will be the US manufacturing sector such as the automotive and civil aircraft industries.
Secondly, the US introduced an additional corporate tax, called the base-erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), which taxes royalties, intra-firm transfers, payments for machinery used in the US, insurance premiums, or payments in any way reducing the gross income of the US-based part of the firm.It is believed that this provision is not WTO-conform as it discriminates against imported goods or services. The inclusion of insurance premiums specifically targets European insurance companies. The EU insurance industry alone estimates that it will be subject to an additional tax of around $2 billion annually. Large insurance and financial companies will need to transfer assets into the US to reduce the BEAT, negatively affecting the efficiency of their operations. Smaller EU financial sector companies might even need to abandon the US market altogether.

Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) in wild birds, captive birds or in poultry
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in wild birds or captive birds

Also, according to OIE recommendations trade restrictions should be limited to the defined infected areas in the country concerned and should not include the whole territory of a country.
Indonesia imposes countrywide bans following outbreaks of both LPAI and HPAI and does not distinguish whether the outbreak is in wild birds, captive birds or in poultry.
This is despite the EU having a solid animal health system and a comprehensive regionalisation strategy, with high level of protection, harmonised rules, based on OIE codes, rigorous controls and enforcement and transparency. Exports from non-infected areas are safe and should therefore be possible. Trading partners should recognise this policy in line with their WTO obligations to minimise negative trade effects as safe trade can continue to take place and thus a country-wide ban is unjustified.  Furthermore, there is a lack of transparency on Indonesia’s regionalization policy and on the notifications of bans in place and procedures  (including timelines) needed to obtain the lifting of restrictions.

10580	False	Active	Indonesia	"Unjustified import restrictions on a number of animals and animal products relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (and other diseases). Recent Regulation 42/2019states that a country of origin for the importation of carcass, meat, edible offal and processed meat of large ruminant must be free from Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), as referred to in Article 8. In alignment with international standards of the OIE on BSE, the Regulation opens for import from negligible status countries and seems to possibly open a door from imports from controlled status countries for imports of large ruminant meat, in the form of boneless/deboned meat, with the exception of Mechanically Separated Meat (MSM) and Mechanically Deboned Meat (MDM), or bone-in meat. In any case, imports are very limited. Indonesian legislation requires both country and establishment approval (through both a declaration (questionnaire), import risk evaluation and on-site assessment) for import of meat and meat products.
This process is burdensome and non-transparent. The criteria for passing the approval process are unclear, thus resulting in a long approval procedure. Related to others diseases, Indonesia require absence of a number of diseases in a country or establishment for which OIE does not consider trade measures necessary.
Trading conditions (not SPS) set in Regulation 42/2019 make even more complicated market access: restrictions on certain cuts and products, , an unclear and complex import license system, including the two-layer requirement to import, i.e. import recommendation from the Agriculture Minister and import permit from the Trade Minister. Also Halal matters are a significant complication. New policies are planned without consulting trading partners, potentially completely banning or severely obstructing imports.
Since the introduction of the ban in 2001 the EU together with trading partners have consistently raised the issue in all available fora, and in bilateral meetings. Update: the regulation 58/2015 apparently might allow imports of countries with controlled risk status, though the wording make this unclear. The EU is still trying to get clarification on this. As mentioned, a number of non-strictly SPS barriers are still present in this regulation.
Update: the regulation 42/2019 continues the same pattern, with apparently allowed imports from countries with controlled risk status but unclear procedures and requirements. The COM made comments in writing but no feedback has been received.

10600	False	Active	Indonesia	"The legislation for food self-sufficiency (Food Law 18/2012) sets out the frame for restricting imports into Indonesia. The Food Law 18/2012 was adopted by Parliament (DPR) on 16 November 2012. Its scope is very broad and affects all elements of food production, trade and marketing. It states, among others, that import and export of food shall only take place in accordance with national food needs effectively allowing to pose a ban on imports. It further stipulates labelling requirements that are unclear (’during entry’) and notes a government ’obligation’ to stabilise food prices. Article 34 mandates that ""staple foods"" can only be exported if domestic consumption is fulfilled and national food reserves are sufficient. Food can only be exported after considering domestic food consumption and national interests. Article 36 mandates that food can only be imported if domestic production is insufficient or the item cannot be produced domestically. Articles 46/51/55/56/108- Allows and notes a government ""obligation"" to stabilize the supply and price of ""staple foods"". This can be done, among other ways, by price fixing, provision and management of food supply and food trading, establishment of tax/tariff policy in favour of national interests, and regulation of import and export. Article 55 protects income and buying power of Indonesian farmers and fishermen, whereas article 56 allows establishing tax and tariffs in favour of national interests.
Burdensome registration and labelling requirements and import conditions for food products. The enforcement of food safety through food sanitation; control of food additives, genetically engineered food products and food irradiation; establishment of food packaging standard; issuing food quality and safety guarantee; and halal product guarantee for those required. Labelling requirements through putting the label inside and/or outside of the food package contains the product’s name, list of used ingredients, net weight, date and production code, and halal (for those required).
Unjustified import restrictions on a number of animals and animal products. Since 2001, Indonesia started applying an import ban on animals and a range of animal products where it considered there was a risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). While there is a certain progression towards international standards in Regulation 42/2019 there are still divergences. The previous pattern of BSE monitoring, however, continues with apparently allowed imports from countries with controlled risk status but unclear procedures and requirements (see also fiche no. 10580). Indonesia requires absence of a number of diseases in a country or establishment for which OIE does not consider trade measures necessary. Indonesia introduced the principle of regionalisation in its legislation from 2009 only for Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and not for other diseases for which OIE also foresees this principle. As an example, Indonesia requires country freedom for African Swine Fever. Regulation 23/2018 amended some parts of the previous regulation 34/2016, adding a requirement for the halal certification of the products.
Law 18/2009 introduced burdensome and non-transparent risk assessment procedures for meat and dairy imports stemming from country establishment approval requirements. The regulation 58/2015, and later 6/2015, contain annexes with conditions for import of certain products of animal origin. For those products not mentioned in the Annex, the EU is seeking information on the import conditions. There is a lack of transparency and undue delay for the approval processes , thus resulting in a long and burdensome approval procedures not in line with the WTO SPS agreement (see also fiche no.14882). This is further compounded by the fact that Indonesia claims to lack resources for carrying out the audits. Law 18/2009 introduced a country and establishment approval entailing that every single exporting establishment need to be inspected. The procedure requires that foreign companies exporting fresh animal products (meat, dairy products, eggs etc.) have to register which are then to be submitted to plant-by-plant inspections. This system is repeated in in Regulation 34/2016 on imports of meat and carcass. This is further compounded by the fact that Indonesia claims to lack resources for carrying out audits.
Since 2016, Indonesia has been imposing very expensive fees for processing a market access application, through Government Regulation/ Peraturan Pemerintah (PP) no. 35/2016 including.

A limit of 3 Argentine Pesos (AR$) per exported US dollar, for tariff lines listed in Annex I of Decree 793/2018 – which in general includes goods with higher added value.

11227	False	Active	Turkey	"Despite the new IP Code adopted in January 2017 and progress in some areas, some issues of IPR enforcement remain unresolved. The length of court proceedings and deficient enforcement of the domestic IPR regulations were identified as the main weaknesses of the current system. IPR infringements are widespread. In particular they concern the field of trademarks, such as the use of bad faith trade marks (i.e. deceiving consumers by using a competitor's trade mark or one that is confusingly similar to it). IPR infringements are affecting various sectors (automotive, cosmetics, medical equipment, food), not just clothing and footwear. The EU companies are affected by the deficient IPR enforcement both in Turkey and in the EU given that based on the reports on EU Customs enforcement services (further steps are needed to better target and intercept IPR infringing shipments that are entering into, transiting through, and being exported from Turkey), Turkey is the country of origin of a large number of counterfeit goods imported to the EU.

11030	False	Active	China	"China remains the EU’s biggest challenge in the area of intellectual property rights. According to the annual DG TAXUD statistics, roughly 90% of all counterfeit goods seized at European borders come every year from China, including Hong Kong. This phenomenon goes beyond lost revenues of IP stakeholders since a significant part of detained articles are products for daily use that could be potentially dangerous to the health and safety of consumers.
Even though significant legislative progress has been made during recent years, IPR protection and enforcement are in many areas still not sufficiently effective. Lengthy registration proceedings and the burdensome legalisation of foreign documents are on-going problems. Substantial concerns exist in particular as regards the low quality standard required for innovation patent and as regards the IPR protection provided for data protection and trade secrets.
Enforcement remains a very serious concern. Despite noteworthy efforts made by China, the access to the Chinese administrative and judicial enforcement system in China remains problematic for EU companies, notably for SMEs. In particular, notarisation and legalisation requirements make the defence of IPRs difficult and time-consuming for foreign right holders. Moreover, interim injunctions are difficult to obtain in practice, the damages awarded by the Courts remain often too low, and the execution of judicial decisions is burdensome. In some cases, signs of selective IPR enforcement are detected when state-owned enterprises or strategic areas are concerned.
In addition, the EU industry suffers from a long-standing discrepancy between the federal and the provincial protection level in China in terms of enforcement effectiveness and efficiency. The recent central anti-corruption campaigns and the creation of specific IPR Courts in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou give hope for a more harmonized level of protection in the future.
Online counterfeiting and piracy have aggravated the enforcement situation. Potential clients of such goods are now only a mouse-click away from having direct access to them at a global level. The delivery of goods in small consignments makes effective customs control impossible. Major Chinese players, such as Alibaba, are increasingly concerned about their reputation (particularly after having been named and shamed in US 301 reports) and take pro-active mesures, without however being able to get the problem under control.
Somewhat related is the active policy of China to make EU companies not exert or even transfer their IP rights as condition to be allowed of having access to the Chinese market. The objective to take over foreign technology in key industrial areas is documented in many Chinese planning documents, most recently in ""Made in China 2025"". The ways to make companies obey to unnessary disclosure and licensing requirements are manifold, such as procurement, standard setting, joint ventures, business registration procedures.

14782	False	Active	South Korea	"The installation of ballast water management systems has not been possible in early 2019 for EU suppliers due to unexpected national type approval requirements for installation on Korean vessels. The lead-time for obtaining type approval in Korea is 1-2 years. The type approval requirements are set out in the Korean Ballast Water Management Act of 21 March 2017.
The Barlast Water Management Convention was adopted in 2004. It entered into force in 2017 and it requires that ballast water is managed in order not to spread invasive species.  From September 2018 all newly built vessels must be equipped with a ballast water management system. Between 2019-2024 all existing vessels must be retrofitted with such a system that has to be approved according to International Maritime Organization (IMO) guidelines or the Ballast Water Management System Code. 
The installation must also be approved by the Flag State to which the vessel belongs. This procedure is normally delegated by Flag States to classification societies. Type approval certificates of ballast water management systems issued by classification societies are recognized by most flag states when issued by another IMO Member State. There are currently 12 classification societies approved by the EU, including the society Korean Register (KR). Consequently, KR is fully authorized as a recognized organization to approve such systems for passenger and cargo ships flying an EU Flag.
The EU accepts type approval certificates issued by the Korean Register, which is the competent Korean classification society. However, Korea in principle only accepts certificates for ballast water manage systems on Korean flagged vessels on condition that all testing, according to the IMO guidelines, has been carried out in Korea. This means that EU suppliers of marine equipment must apply for a new type approval certificate from the Korean Register. The certificate must then be approved by the Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.

11226	False	Active	Turkey	"Import surveillance certificate regime consists in a requirement to obtain a surveillance license prior to the import of different products if their price is below a certain threshold defined by the authorities via different communiqués. The scope of this mechanism is broad. The Turkish authorities put regularly in place communiqués through which different products enter in the scope of this measure.
Prior to the import operation, and if the imported products' price is below the above mentioned threshold, the importer has to apply for a surveillance license to the Ministry of Trade. The application file contains information about the importer, the declarant (if different than the importer), the exporter, the producer and information about the imported product. Documents such as the original or notary-certified copy of the list of the authorized signatures of declarant, copies of the proforma invoice or the commercial invoice concerning the product to be imported should be provided with the application for surveillance certificate. However, additional information and documents may be requested by the Turkish authorities. This makes the measure similar to a non-automatic licence.
Turkey removed paper products from the scope of Turkey’s import surveillance scheme, after a proceeding conducted by the Commission based on a complaint by EU industry on the basis of the EU’s Trade Barriers Regulation.

Background
COFEPRIS was established in 2001 by breaking out various directorates of the Ministry of Health to enhance the risk management in the public health sector. In the 2008 public health sector reform the responsibility for the registration of about 10,000 pharmaceuticals and 40,000 medical devices was attributed to COFEPRIS. But COFEPRIS suffered from a lack of updated referentials to technical regulations and of well trained staff, offices, computers etc. This resulted in a backlog of registrations of medical and agro-chemical products. Since 2011 the situation has improved, although there are some on-going difficulties with the registration process of new molecules. The Commissioner, who is in office since March 2011, made effective administrative changes to reduce the administrative burdens (third party pre-validation, narrowing down the number of medical devices that need approval, i.e. exempting low risk ones), facilitated registrations and increased transparency of the institution. But the industry views that these initiatives are not enough to address appropriately the underlying problem of lack of resources and qualified staff of COFEPRIS.
The approval process is composed on 3 stages:1st stage: COFEPRIS (Comisión Federal para la Protección contra Riesgos Sanitarios),2nd stage: CSG (Consejo de salubridad General) of the Ministry of Health and3rd stage: ISSSTE (Instituto de seguridad y servicios sociales de los trabajadores del estado) covering public workers - IMSS (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social) covering workers in the private sector and funded by both public and private sources - SP (Seguro Popular) covering unaffiliated persons and is publicly financed.
The 3rd stage seems to be the most problematic one. The first two stages approve the molecules for scientific use but the molecules are not approved for purchasing and using them for patients in the medical sector. Although COFEPRIS has a rejection rate of around 5% since 2010, IMSS has only released 4% of the molecules approved by COFEPRIS, down from 24% in 2011.
Equivalency agreementsOn 5 October 2012, Mexico unilaterally granted recognition of sanitary registrations emitted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for new medicines. Equivalency was also granted to a number of other countries.
Registration of agro-chemical productsThe main problems for EU companies to register agro-chemicals are excessive delays, the confidentiality of provided information and unclear procedures.

This limitation derives from article 7 of the Turkish Import Code (Council of Ministers n°1995/7606 published in December 1995). On the basis of this article 7, the Undersecretariat for Foreign Trade (UFT) issues a new communiqué every year as part of the Turkish Import Regime to list products which might be exempted from the import licensing and under which conditions. The Communiqués contain three different annexes (lists) corresponding to three import regimes:
• The list 1/A includes products that can be imported without any license. This list mainly covers a limited number of machinery which can be directly used by the Turkish manufacturing industry.
• The list 1/B requires listed products to obtain a ""letter of clearance"" from the Turkish institutions indicated in the list itself.
• The list 2 covers also mainly machinery products which can only be imported freely if the declared value is higher than a minimum (CIF) price (indicated in the Communiqué).
The last Communiqué 2014/9, adopted in December 2013, includes the three different import regimes mentioned above and adds 36 products to the list 1/A (fully liberalised products). 30 of these products were in the List 2 (goods liberalised only if above a minimum price) of the Communiqué 2013/9.

However, the list of fully liberalised products in the Communiqué 2014/9 does not include the products identified by the Commission's letter to the Turkish authorities of 14 March 2011. These products were only partially liberalised in 2012 (if above a minimum price). In addition, one of these products – the retreaded tyres – was not included in any of the liberalisation lists and the current import regime for these products is similar to de facto import ban. The reasons put forward by Turkey with regard to the import ban are based on environmental considerations (increase of waste accumulation because of their life cycle). However, retreaded tyres are type-approved under UNECE Regulations 108/109, and therefore legally accepted for commercialisation under same conditions (including guarantee) as new ones. Turkey is a signatory of those UNECE Regulations, and furthermore allows retreaded tyres on its market, but continues to ban the EU exports"	False	01 Dec 2005	08 Oct 2019	False	Import licenses for old-second hand-renovated goods	[{'id': 106, 'sps': False, 'code': '0302', 'name': 'Non-automatic import licencing', 'parentId': None, 'active': True}]	[]	[{'id': 5, 'code': 'S0000', 'name': 'Horizontal ', 'active': True}]
11281	False	Active	Mexico	"Mexican labelling requirements are in many cases complex and difficult to comply with. Main affected sectors are textiles and ceramic tiles. Mexico requires information on the labels which is different from, or in addition to, internationally agreed practices. This implies additional costs for EU exporters who have to design specific labels for the Mexican market.
 
Background
EU exporters of consumer products such as textiles and ceramic tiles have complained about the burdensome and costly labelling requirements in Mexico. Labelling in a permanent manner is often required for the Mexican market. These requirements imply that European companies have to dedicate significant resources to study the Mexican labelling requirements, to gather information and  to perform specific tasks for complying with Mexican rules.
Main cases
TextilesMexican labelling requirements for textile products are more trade restrictive than necessary and have a negative impact on EU textile exports. EU exporters complain about excessive labelling requirements regarding the indication of size, trademark, name of the manufacturer and data on the importer which are considered burdensome and entailing additional costs. In fact, this implies designing a special label for the Mexican market i.e. it is not possible to use the same label for all Spanish speaking countries which would make sense in economic terms. In practise, before producing a label, exporters may have to send their customers a pro-forma invoice so that importers can verify the information provided. Many companies have opted to use a permanent label with the information required even if some might be given through a non-permanent one. Importers or manufacturers use in many cases voluntarily the services of Verification Units, which are private entities authorised to control the conformity of labels with Mexican rules, which cause high costs.
The EU requests that the obligation to indicate the name and address of manufacturer or importer in the label of textile products is eliminated in particular because this information exists normally in the customs accompanying documents and that customs controls are accelerated and kept on a random basis in particular because textile products do not pose serious health risks. Tests of Mexican authorities to verify products conformity with Mexican legislation should be done without delay and after the products have been released in the market (i.e. immediate customs clearance before test results are known).
Ceramic TilesEU exporters of ceramic tiles face the difficulty and extra costs of excessive labelling requirements. This includes putting specific labels for the Mexican market on the products and/or labelling each package (instead of one label for one consignment) with specific information, such as the fiscal number of the importer, information which is normally not known at that stage, and other special characteristics to be respected for each label. This can also imply manual re-packaging of the goods in a customs warehouse, which is a costly process and leads to delays before goods can be marketed.
The EU has referred several times during the Special Committee on Standards and Technical Regulation to the problematic labelling requirements imposed by Mexico, particularly the obligation to indicate the name of the importer on each individual tile box. The EU has suggested that only the basic information should be required to be on the label, allowing for the rest to be stated on commercial support documents."

Under the SON-CAP regime, imported goods need to undergo pre-shipment certification through authorized service providers. Goods are only released at arrival upon production of completed SON-CAP certificates. The cost of this procedure amounts to some $600 per container/per product; meaning that for mixed shipments (containing different products) this fee will multiply accordingly. Validity of certificates varies between 6 months and 1 year.
Under the obligatory e-registration scheme, introduced in 2013, all products (i.e. both imported and locally manufactured) in the above sectors have to be registered electronically on Standards Organisation of Nigeria’s online platform. The goal is to provide an online database to support SON in tracking and tackling substandard goods in the Nigerian market. http://www.son.gov.ng/.
Discussions with concerned parties/stakeholders indicate that per product and model (even change of colour, size or type), registration costs about (additional) $ 600 per item. The maximum validity period for e-registration is 1 year only. This duration is short and represents additional costs for the importer, who is required to renew registration after a year, at most, even when there is no change in the product.In addition to the huge fees, importers face difficulties in using SONs online platform, where key documents and information on the new e-registration system are absent"	True	13 Apr 2010	04 Oct 2019	False	SON-CAP and e-Registration of machinery and electronic equipment (standardisation measure)	[{'id': 103, 'sps': False, 'code': '0201', 'name': 'Standards and Other technical requirements', 'parentId': None, 'active': True}]	"[{'@objid': 46, 'id': 275, 'sps': False, 'code': '2701', 'name': 'Coal;

Despite all efforts and new audits organised to verify corrective measures taken the measures against Germany remain.
 
On 1 August 2014 Russia announced a ban on fruit and vegetables from Poland allegedly on the basis of the discovery of a pest declared to be absent in Poland but present in Russia and many other European countries.  6 days following the introduction of the ban the entire EU fruit and vegetable exports got blocked by the political embargo.
In June 2015, following inspections organised in May 2015 Russia banned all fishery products from Estonia and Latvia allegedly on the basis of shortcomings identified on the system control systems.  Following the provision of information on corrective measures Russia organised new visits in autumn 2016. The reports of those inspections were only made available in November 2017.

10682	False	Active	Japan	"Many food additives of worldwide common use, which are recognised as being safe by international food safety bodies such as the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), remain prohibited in Japan. This has been a long-standing trade irritant as EU exporters have not been able to export certain processed food to Japan or would need to modify the recipes accordingly.
 Japanese list of accepted food additives is not fully in line with the applicable international standards set up at the CODEX Alimentarius. Japan still does not accept some additives recognized as safe by food safety evaluation bodies such as the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the EC Scientific Committee on Food or the European Food Safety Authority. In 2002, the EU and Japan agreed on a list of 46 priority food additives that the Japanese would approve in an accelerated pace. The priority list has in practice been finalised in 2015 except food additives containing aluminium. The finalisation of the first priority list could have been seen as a first step towards the harmonisation of the Japanese legislation on food additives with international standards, in accordance with the provisions of the WTO SPS Agreement. However, beyond the first priority list there are still other food additives not yet approved by Japan.
Since several new food additives are approved every year in the EU, the procedural aspect is of critical importance for the future. In terms of transparency, the Japanese authorities have issued, published and translated into English the majority of the relevant guidelines related to the approval process:

Guidelines for the Designation of Flavoring Agents (30 November 2016)[1]
Guidelines for the Designation of Food Additives and Revision of Standards for Use of Food Additives (30 November 2016)[2]
Guidelines for the Assessment of Flavoring Substances in Foods on Health (22 December 2016)[3]
Guideline for Assessment of the Effect of Food on Human Health Regarding Food Additives[4]
Procedure for Preparing Application Documents for Designation of Food Additives and Revision of Use Standards for Food Additives[5].

The application and overview documents for approval of food additives need to be in Japanese but the reference documents are acceptable in English.
The standard processing time for Japan’s designation process of food additives is now set to be two years; one year for the risk assessment by the Food Safety Commission (FSC) and another year for approval procedure by the Ministry for Health Labour and Welfare. Furthermore, Japan established a consultation centre (Food Additive Designation Consultation Center - FADCC) to assist foreign applicants. As in the EU, the Japanese authorisation system requires a direct application for approval by industry.
The Commission will monitor the proper follow-up by the Japanese authorities, under the EPA mechanism, should such applications eventually be submitted.

Since October 2017 Tunisia applies a set of new non-tariff barriers to curb imports.

Prohibition to grant credit for the importation of goods. Since October 2017 the Central Bank forbids commercial banks from granting credit for the importation of a list of 220 products deemed non-essential (including cosmetics, alcoholic drinks, electrical appliances, food, construction materials, school supplies and ready-to-wear fashion). Please note that this prohibition was finally eliminated by the Central Bank on 21 December 2018. 
Export declaration. Since October 2017 Tunisia obliges importers to submit the export declaration from the country of origin for a long list of products. The claimed aim is to fight under invoicing, especially from China. Despite reiterated EU concerns, Tunisia has not agreed to exempt EU products.
Free sale certificate. Since October 2017 importers of cosmetics, toys and school supplies are requested to provide a certificate of free sale in the country of origin. In the case of cosmetics this request is in place since 2016. Tunisia has not notified the new measure to WTO, despite the EU request to do so.  
Delays for products subject to technical controls. Since October 2017 products submitted to technical controls can no longer clear customs - with a provisional authorisation by the Ministry of Trade - before the technical control results become available, which can take up to 2-6 months. In the meantime the containers remain blocked at the port. This new practice worsens the already burdensome technical import controls which, despite EU requests, remain systematic and void of risk analysis.

Excise taxes have been imposed on a large number of products and collected by the customs. No proof that these taxes are collected from the local producers , as unlike the VAT, the tax doesn't appear on the purchase invoices/ bills

11188	False	Active	United States of America	"The Lacey Act, initially adopted in 1900, is the United States' oldest national wildlife protection statute and serves as an anti-trafficking law protecting a broad range of wildlife and wild plants. In May 2008, the Lacey Act was amended to extend its scope to all plants, including timber or associated wood products with the objective to combat illegal logging. The amendment added a new requirement for an import declaration, which will oblige importers of covered plants and plant products to list shipment information along with information such as plant scientific name and country of harvest to prove compliance with the Lacey Act requirements. Domestic products are not subject to similar reporting requirements.
Import declaration requirements have been all phased in according to a schedule established in the 2008 amendments. In the initial phase (which started on 15th December 2008), the declaration was voluntary. Obligatory declarations were gradually phased in starting from 1 April 2009 as regards certain wood products (HTS Chapter 44), and as regards some additional products from 1 April 2010 onwards (umbrellas, hand tools, pianos, stringed instruments, revolvers and pistols, seats with wood frames, sculptures).

11880	False	Active	United States of America	"The EU welcomed the ruling by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Appellate Body on 28 March 2019, vindicating the EU’s long held position that the United States has taken no steps to comply with WTO rules on support to Boeing. The ruling concluded definitively that the US has continued to subsidise the company illegally despite previous rulings condemning this behaviour. This has caused significant harm to its European competitor Airbus. The ruling by the WTO's Appellate Body confirmed the European Union's position that the United States has failed to remove the massive and trade distorting subsidies it is granting to Boeing. The WTO sided with the EU in its argument that several US measures, notably the Washington State tax programme and business incentives from South Carolina are in fact subsidies. The Appellate Body dismissed all of the US appeal points.
Significantly, the Appellate Body supported the EU claim that Boeing still benefits from an illegal tax concession granted by the US through an export support measure (through the Foreign Sales Corporation and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion, or FSC/ETI). This subsidy had already been qualified as prohibited at the first stages of the dispute. Prohibited subsidies are considered the most trade distortive category of subsidies and are illegal under WTO rules.
The Appellate Body also found that US subsidies to Boeing continue to cause severe damage to Airbus' market opportunities, notably in the form of lost sales.
In 2012 the WTO ruled that the United States had granted massive subsidies to Boeing in violation of WTO rules. Between 1989 and 2006 Boeing benefited from NASA, US Department of Defence and Washington State/Kansas subsidies totalling over $5 billion.
The subsidies allowed Boeing to sell its aircraft more cheaply, to the detriment of Airbus.
Following the adoption of the WTO ruling on compliance on 11 April 2019, the EU requested the Article 22.6 Arbitrator to resume its work. The arbitration proceedings is currently on going. Upon the completion of the Arbitrator’s work (expected in the first half of 2020), the EU will request the DSB for an authorisation to take countermeasures against the US. The Commission has started preparations under the Enforcement Regulation for such a step, by publishing on 17 April 2019 a preliminary list seeking views of EU stakeholders on US products that may be subject to EU commercial policy measures."

Importers must bear the costs of the RFID equipment and of the marking of each individual product. In addition, information must be provided to the Federal Tax Service (i.e. name of the manufacturer, product characteristics).
The measure is burdensome, costly and time consuming. EBCA is also concerned that this requirement is extended to other textile and clothing products in the forthcoming months.
The Regulation entered into force on 12 August 2016. The process has been delayed as the EEU authorities were awaiting the signature of the President of Kyrgystan.
 
In April 2018 Russia adopted a measure (Decision 792-p of April 2018), requiring electronic marking of different categories of products as of the dates below. Each individual piece receives a unique code, which has to be registered in customs and at every step of the logistic chain.

13923	False	Active	Turkey	"In 2017 Turkey introduced so-called `additional liabilities` (by Decision 2017/10926 of the Council of Ministers of 11 September 2017). These are compensatory levies that raise the level of the EU`s Generalised Scheme Preferences (GSP) tariffs to the level of Turkey`s existing applicable duties for imports of several countries to which Turkey should normally apply the EU`s GSP tariffs – whenever those goods are imported into Turkey via the EU.
Turkey replaced Decision 2017/10926 with Decision 2018/11799 dated 22 June 2018 (attached please find a Turkish copy) and extended the scope to all products falling under the Customs Union except Chapter 93 and excluding ECS products and agricultural products (Chapters 5,9,13 to 15, 17 to 22, 24 and 44 to 46).

European shipping companies are heavily affected by this VAT obligation. In contrast to Algerian companies, they, not being Algerian residents, are not in the possibility to recover the VAT. As a consequence this VAT obligation makes operations in Algeria almost one fifth more expensive for non Algerian companies, including European ones. The imposition of VAT on services rendered to vessels and cargo goes against international practice in the shipping sector. Moreover, Algerian shipping companies are – as any shipping company - subject to a zero VAT rate in the Member States of the European Union, according to European law and national legislation implementing the European legal rules (Directive 2006/112/EC).

Normally one should expect importers, having ordered goods from abroad under letters of credit, to take delivery of the goods soon after arrival, i.e. in a matter of few days or weeks.- In practice, however, we observe that many importers delay taking receipt of their cargoes, quite some even many months after arrival. This means that the shipping line has to wait for payment and containers remain blocked for other use in shipping.- It sets restrictions in the repatriation of freights by the shipping lines. Any income from freight due to the shipping lines and received by the line’s agent from importers later than 90 days after arrival of the vessel may not be transferred outside Algeria.- Algeria does not allow operators which share vessels in order to ensure more frequent calls and higher quality to open disbursement accounts (system of slot chartering).- very cumbersome and time consuming control system of customs for the final disbursement account are in place, thus costly for all concerned and delaying legitimate transfers.
At the end of 2015, as a result of pressure from the EU, rules were changed for the future (notably by allowing operators to open supplementary disbrusement accounts for pyaments received beyond the 90 day-deadline). The Algerian authorities, however, modified the logistical rules charging the costs related to the management of empty containers on shipowners: in the past, as can be seen from the bill of lading conditions, the cost of empty container operations, including reloading, was paid by Algerian receivers."

The decree of Minister of Trade, signed on 26 January 2019 (and published in the Official Journal of 27 January 2019), defines the list of goods and the rate applicable to each product line (between 30% and 200% of the value of the goods), which has been drawn up by an ad-hoc inter-ministerial committee. The total number of affected products is 1095 and the application started with the publication of the list.
The intention of the Algerian government is to change the list frequently (several times a year) according to the evolving needs of domestic industry.

The number of affected products in the revised list is 992. The positive impact of this amendment on EU export interests is nevertheless limited.
Algerian authorities have not defined the legal duration of the measures: in bilateral meetings, they have hinted at a duration between 2 and 5 years.

11200	False	Active	Algeria	"Restrictions to foreign direct investment were introduced under the 2009 complementary Budget Law  (""LFC 2009"") on 26 July 2009 and subsequently extended in scope under the 2014 Budget Law. The recent Investment Code of 3 August 2016 introduced a few relevant modifications and no longer features the FEC (or ""51/49 rule""), which continues nonetheless to apply by virtue of the Finance Laws of 2009 and 2014.   These measures, which have the effect of deterring foreign direct investment, include the following provisions:  - generalised limitations on foreign ownership: minimum Algerian shareholding of 51 % for all sectors;  - any foreign investment exceeding 5 billion DZD must be approved by the National Investment Council;  - foreign investors must maintain a positive foreign-currency account for the whole duration of the investment and must secure the finance to cover project costs from local sources;  There are also some restrictions (more de facto than de jure, it seems) to the transfer of benefits generated through foreign investment. One particular aspect of this general obstacle is illustrated by the freezing in 2010  of assets deposited on ship-owners' disbursement accounts. On the basis of a new regulation adopted end-2015, this problem should not arise  in the future, as operators will be allowed to open complementary disbursement accounts for payments effected after the initial 90 days of the arrival of the goods. However, the Algerian authorities are yet to allow ship-owners to transfer pre-existing credits, which accrued under the old regulation.  There have been suggestions that the Government may consider amending further the 51/49 rule and limiting its scope of application to certain sectors only, but this has not materialised to-date. Algerian authorities seem to consider that the current investment flow in the country, albeit low relatively to the rest of the region, is satisfactory.
In the discussions leading to the Budget Law for 2019/2020, some declarations of the Governement suggest that the rule may be amended so that its scope would be limited to strategic sectors (as the EU has been advocating in its discussions with Algeria)."

13027	False	Active	Lebanon	"The Lebanese Parliament passed in August 2017 a fiscal law which, among other measures, introduced additional excise duties on alcohol products; this law was immediately suspended and sent to the Lebanese Constitutional Council which declared it unconstitutional on 3 October. Following the verdict, the Lebanese Government re-drafted the law taking into consideration the comments of the Constitutional Council; the new version was approved by the Parliament on 9 October and is now legally applicable.
 The new law includes several measures, like the increase of the VAT and the corporate income tax. It also includes the increase of tax on alcohol products.
 This provision provides for a beer tax of 180 Lebanese Pounds (ca. € 0.10) per litre as compared to 60 LBP previously in effect; wine: 600 LBP (ca. € 0.34) vs 200 previously; whiskey and spirits: 1,200 LBP (ca. € 0.68) vs. 400 pounds previously. These amounts are below the provisions of the previous tax law, but if applied are still against our Association Agreement.
After the passing of the new law, the EU contacted the Lebanese authorities at the highest level and received the assurance that, in accordance with the Association Agreement, the duties will not be applied to EU shipments. This assurance has been confirmed at the EU-Lebanon Trade SubCommittee on 7 March 2018. Nevertheless, EU exporters have communicated to DG Trade that the additional tax is being imposed. DG Trade has requested clarification to the Lebanese authorities at the 4th EU-Lebanon Joint Working Group of 23 July 2018 and received the confirmation that, for legal and administrative reason, ""it is not possible to exempt EU exports"". Lebanese authorities committted to find a solution to the barrier.

All production facilities of any new products sold in Nigeria are physically inspected and the import rights are linked to a Nigerian partner needed for the registration at the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC).
All products to be imported in the sectors of agriculture and fisheries, wines & spirits, food and beverages, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and some other industries have to be registered at NAFDAC. The registration process is very complex and takes a long time. The continuous increase of registration fees is excessive and appears to be much higher for imported products compared to locally manufactured products. Since the NAFDAC procedures changed in 2002, NAFDAC representatives physically inspect all production facilities of any new products sold in Nigeria. This increases the costs. Companies have to register every product type and a separate registration fee has to be paid for different sizes of the same product type.
Foreign companies also complain that in practice it is too difficult to register their goods themselves at NAFDAC although the procedure allows for it. A Nigerian partner (such as a distributor) is required who registers the product in his name. Consequently the Nigerian partner (and not the foreign exporter) obtains the import rights, which can create problems in case the partner needs to be changed.

13742	False	Active	Thailand	"Measures at stake:
- Ministerial Regulation entitled ''Liquor Importation Permission'' No.2, dated 7 May 2019, published in the Royal Gazette on 4 June 2019, taking effect on 5 June 2019. This Ministerial Regulation amended the Ministerial Regulation of the same title, dated 16 September 2017.
- Notification of the Excise Department entitiled ''Standards of Imported Liquor'' dated and taking effect from 5 June 2019.
Original measure
The new Excise Tax regime has introduced a requirement for alcohol quality analysis as a part of alcohol import licensing. According to the Ministerial Regulation concerning import licensing of alcohol products, the analysis can be carried out by the Excise Department's laboratory or the importers can also submit a Certificate of Analysis (COA) issued by recognised bodies in the country of origin based on the relevant standards of the Thai Industrial Standards Institute. For an analysis by the Excise Department's laboratory, importers have to submit alcohol sample (1 bottle and at least 0.5 litre) to the Excise Department. The COA remained valid until there is a change in the production method. For wines, a change in vintage did not require another testing. Since the Ministerial Regulation entered into force in September 2017, the Excise Department has granted a grace period allowing importers to submit sample for testing or a COA within 30 days after importation. Initially, the grace period was supposed to come to an end in mid - March 2018. However, the grace period has so far been extended twice to mid - September 2018 and then mid - March 2019.
The main problem for the EU is that the technical standards required by the Excise Department are the outdated voluntary standards of the Thai Industrial Standards Institute issued in 2001 and do not align with international or European alcohol standards. Certain substances regulated are not allowed in the European products while the maximum residue limits of some substances are lower than the European standards (i.e. Maximum Residue limits are more stringent than the ones set in OIV). As such, some European products may not be able to be marketed in Thailand (Sherry in case of aldehyde and Sauternes and Tokaji in case of sulphur dioxide). Thirdly, the Excise notification concerning criteria, methodologies and conditions for the manufacturing of alcohol products (dated 29 September 2017) states that ""local community distilled spirits and wines"" are exempted from the analytical testing for certain substances, creating discrimination in favour of local products.
The Excise Department attempted to develop its own standards in order to solve the problems arising from the difference between the TISI standards and international ones. In October 2018, the Excise Department informally approached the EU Delegation and other concerning Embassies to seek comment on its draft COA and proposal on standards. However, the draft standards proposed by the Excise Department are substantially similar to the TISI standards with an exception of sulphur dioxide in wine, in which the Excise has proposed to increase the limit from 300 mg/litre to 350 mg/litre for all types of wines, citing the limit in the CODEX. In response, the EU Delegation reiterated its concerns to the Excise Department. The Excise Department started consultations with other relevant government agencies in December 2018 to find a solution on this issue.
While the measure has been in place since September 2017, it was notified to the WTO TBT Committee on 15 November 2018 following a series of calls from trading partners including the EU.
Developments in 2019
In March 2019, the Excise Department and the EU Delegation had a meeting again. The Excise Department presented a proposal on the new set of alcohol standards to the EU Delegation in Bangkok. The proposed standards eliminates the discrimination in the standards in favour of domestic artisanal products and significantly takes on board the EU's comments on the limits of certain substances. For example, The limits of fusel oil, ester and ferrous as well as copper for wines and of sulfur dioxide and copper for distilled spirits are removed. In particular, the limit for sulfur dioxide for wine is raised to 400 mg/litre, sufficiently accommodating the concerned sweet wines from the EU (notably, Sauternes and Tokaji).
That being said, there remain some differences between the European and Thai standards (both in terms of testing methodology and the regulated limits) and the limits of fusel oil for distilled spirits and of aldehyde for wines remain the same. The latter, according to the European industry may present risk for the access of old aged whiskies and sherry wines to the Thai market. However, based on the experience of European importers in Thailand, there has not been so far the case that these products fail to satisfy the concerned limits. The EU Delegation has recommended the Member States based in Thailand and European importers to monitor the implementation.
Regarding the frequency of testing, the COAs will be valid for three years following the date of issuance, instead of having a validity until there is a change in the production method as it was in the previous regime. The existing COAs issued prior to the entry into force of the new regime also enjoy a grandfather clause, granting validity for these COAs until June 2022. Similar to the previous regime, the COAs issued recognised bodies in the country of origin based on an equivalent testing method are also accepted. The same rules are applied to domestically produced alcohols. European industry based in Thailand does not have any objection to this move.

It in particular harmonises the tax base using the ''suggested retail price''. For alcohol products, the Excise Tax Code also foresees specific taxes with increased ceilings. The ad valorem tax ceiling, on the other hand, has been reduced.
 
The previously existing sale license fees discrimination, based on the origin of the goods, has been eliminated through the introduction of a new license regime in the new Excise Tax Code based on the volume of sales (wholesale and retail). Prior to the enactment of the new Excise Tax Code, the Excise Department promised that the existing discrimination in tax rates between local fruit wines and imported grape wines will also be eliminated. However, the final version of the code only reduces the discrimination gap. 
 
The discrimination in tax rates between local and imported white spirits has been slightly reduced, in line with the earlier promise of the excise tax department the discrimination will be gradually eliminated.
 
The price threshold system for wines has been maintained (adjusting from last whole sale price to suggested retail price). The threshold triggering the ad valorem tax increases from 600 THB at wholesale level to 1,000 THB at retail level. The industry does not express concern on this move.

11268	False	Active	Russian Federation	"Despite some improvements in the Russian IPR regime (legislation and court rulings), numerous problems continue to hamper the effective protection of intellectual property rights in Russia, in particular in terms of enforcement.
Russia has made some progress in addressing the mass replication of counterfeit optical disks on its territory and that of the Customs Union. However, internet piracy (including but not limited to social networks) remains a great concern, and there is only piecemeal progress at best with regard to the goal of approximating Russian copyright legislation in this area to EU and US models.
Sale and use of counterfeit goods using trademarks for clothes, luxury products, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals products are also widespread and take place both in street markets and in mainstream retail. Furthermore, systematic infringements of patents, commercial secrets and know-how in innovative sectors such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, mechanical engineering and the IT industry continue to injure EU businesses.
There is also misappropriation of intellectual property rights through obtaining patents for alleged inventions or through registering trademarks that are identical or strikingly similar to the trademarks of foreign companies.
The establishment of the Customs Union between Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus on 1 January 2010 (the Eurasian Economic Union since 2015) has on balance created additional risks for IPR protection. The borders of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan continue to be under-patrolled, allowing for entry of counterfeit goods and for illegitimate parallel imports from Asian countries, notably China.
Russia's accession to the WTO and the creation of the new Russian IPR Court in early 2013 could over time prove positive developments.
 
On the positive side, the signature of the EU-Kazakhstan EPCA and the EU-Armenia CEPA gives the EU a leverage to influence the EAEU, notably in view on the provisions on national / regional exhaustion that these agreements contain.

This remains a relevant issue although the situation has evolved since 2008. Russian customs increasingly rely on average prices for the purposes of customs valuation and there is a tendency to revise upwards declared values because customs officers have been made by law personally liable for any undervaluation.

In December 2018 the CBN added fertilisers to the list (https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2018/TED/TED.FEM.FPC.GEN.01.006.pdf ) and in March 2019 it added textiles, bringing the number of items for which access to forex is restricted to 43.
In statements made in June 2019, the Governor of the CBN announced the CBN's intention to blacklist firms (including their Directors and top management) involved in importing any ""restricted goods"" and to deny them access from banking services in Nigeria (see in particular the following document at page 66) https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2019/CCD/Five-Year%20Policy%20Thrust%20-%20CBN.pdf.
If effectively implemented, this new policy would implicitly transform the 43 items list into an additional (unofficial)  import ban list enforced by the CBN, alongside with the official import ban list enforced by the Nigerian Custom Service.

11223	False	Active	Turkey	"In the framework of the Customs Union between EU and Turkey, duty-free tariff quotas for processed agricultural products have been established and set out in the EC-Turkey Association Council Decision 1/2007. The duty-free tariff quotas cover a list of processed agricultural products on both sides, among others, chocolates, bakery products, pasta and sugar confectionery. The Mininstry of Economy (MoE) is the competent authority in charge of the management of the tariff quota system in Turkey. For the allocation of quotas, the principle used in the EU and set in the Turkish legislation is that of ’first come-first served’. In July 2018, Turkey introduced a new tariff quota allocation method based on the order of customs’ declaration registration number. In this framework, tariff quotas for PAPs would be allocated according to this new method without any specific requirement, such as quantity and type of applicant.
With regard to the requirement for importers to be also producers in order to have the right to apply for tariff quotas, it should be noted that there has been some progress; currently the restriction of being a domestic producer applies only to the products covered by the following tariff lines 1704.10-chewing gum, 1704.90 – other sugar confectionery (excluding 1704.90.10) and 18.06 – chocolate and other food containing cocoa (excluding 1806.10.15)."

11167	False	Active	Thailand	"1) Customs valuation: Since 1 September 2006, Thailand systematically used a theoretical value to determine the customs value instead of the declared transaction value, (C.I.F), thus substantially increasing the amount of customs duties and indirect taxes imposed on imported products. . After formal WTO consultations in 2008 on the valuation of spirits, Thailand quickly adhered to correct valuation practices. However, other problems have been encountered with other sectors (for example imported cars).
In 2017 a new Customs Law was adopted. Under the new Act, the old provision that granted discretionary power to the Director General of Customs to determine customs values was repealed. Section 16 of the new Act specifies that ""the rules, procedures and conditions in using the value or to calculate the value shall be specified in a Ministerial Regulation"". This Regulation came into force on 13 November 2017. It applies the methodologies and conditions outlined in the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement to determine the customs value.
2) Customs reward and penalty schemes: The Customs Act of 1926 imposed penalties for customs offences without making any difference between the type of violation (smuggling, duty evasion, avoidance of control measures (e.g. importing without a proper license)). It foresaw a fine of up to four times the price of the goods concerned including duties and/or imprisonment for up to ten years - regardless as to whether the offence was intentional or not. The goods were confiscated. Similar penalties were foreseen for those assisting in the violation. This penalty system was combined with a reward scheme for customs officials and informants, an amount varying between 25% and 55% of the fine or of the proceeds of the sale of the confiscated goods. This system created strong incentives for Customs officials to further investigate unwarranted allegations and a bias to interpret unintentional errors or omissions as customs offences.
 The new Customs Act (2017) introduces more proportionality. The level of the penalty is established according to the offence committed. It also introduces the notion of intent for duty evasion. Caps on the rewards for customs officials and the commissions for informants have been introduced (on average 20% of the fine or the proceeds of the sale of the goods concerned (maximum 5 million Baht) are granted to the group of customs officials involved in the investigation and the same amount to the informants – no commission shall be paid to informants in case of duty evasion). 

3) Inconsistent preferential rules of origin practices/local content  : Companies manufacturing and assembling cars in Thailand in the Customs Free Zone are affected by different practices by different Thai authorities when it comes to compliance with the preferential rules of origin. When the car is intended for export outside Thailand, it will be deemed to have fulfilled the Thai/ASEAN origin requirement with 40% local content. However, when an identical car produced under the same conditions is brought from the Free Zone into the Thai domestic market, the Thai Customs will impose more stringent conditions for the determination of local content (through a different consideration of cost elements). Similar difficulties were raised by manufacturers of other products, such producers of optical lenses. This issue is deemed as solved.
4) The de minimis threshold: The Thai Customs apply a de minimis regime that exempts goods with the value of THB 1,500 (around € 40) or less from customs duties and sales tax (the amount was increased in 2015, from THB 1,000). This threshold is considered to be too low to facilitate trade, support e-commerce, reduce costs, in particular for SMEs, and free up resources for Customs. The EU therefore encourages the Thai Government to raise its de minimis threshold to a level closer to the regional average (around $ 160 / € 135 / THB 5,000) or at least THB 3,000 (€ 80) in order to enhance supply-chain connectivity.
 
5) Appeal Procedure: The new Customs Act has addressed some of the flaws of the appeal system under the old customs Act: lengthy appeal procedures (up to 5 years) without any binding timeline and broad composition of the appeal commission that rendered difficult the possibility to convene a meeting of the appellate body. Under the new law, the timeframe for the Appeal Commission to issue its decision has been set to 180 days. However, it does not specify the date from which the 180-day period for customs to consider an appeal case will start running. It was reported by Customs that there is a ""common understanding"" with businesses that the starting date taken into consideration for the 180-day period is the date of acceptance as stamped by Customs on the appeal application file.
In addition, the appellant cannot bring the case to judicial review as long as the 180-day period for appeal is not completed.
 
6) Transit: While the new Customs Act does not amend the definition of transit, it provides for a clearer set of rules on the process. It notably regulates the timeline involving transit and the treatment of the goods when this timeline is not respected; it specifies the grounds for a restriction or a prohibition of the transit of certain goods. 
The definition of transit remains silent on the application of commercial policy measures on goods in transit. It only clarifies that goods in transit are not subject to duties. The scope of non-customs border measures that apply to shipments in transit remains therefore unclear.  Business also complains that the conditions linked to transit are stringent and not business-friendly as they increase the logistical costs: for instance goods in transit and goods for import cannot be transported together in a same vehicle, there is no consolidation possible for goods destined for different customs-free zones in Thailand on a same vehicle.
7) Duty re-assessmentand post-audit: According to the new Customs Act, the re-assessment timeframe (to be initiated within 3 years following the declaration date) can be extended to up to 2 + 5 additional years (two additional years if Customs could not complete the re-assessment within the initial time period of 3 years; five additional years in case customs has sufficient proof of intent of duty evasion). A total post-audit can therefore be carried out up to 10 years following the submission of the import declaration"	True	01 Jan 2007	16 Dec 2019	False	Customs issues	[{'id': 100, 'sps': False, 'code': '0101', 'name': 'Tariff measures or practices, including TRQ', 'parentId': None, 'active': True}]	[]	[{'id': 5, 'code': 'S0000', 'name': 'Horizontal ', 'active': True}]

11414	False	Active	Venezuela	"Venezuela maintained an exchange control that took different schemes since February 2003, in which restrictions applied to all kind of transactions in foreign currency, including foreign trade as well as financial and capital transactions. However, effective from 7 September, 2018, a new Exchange Agreement Nº 1 was adopted between the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (O.G. 6405 (e), which established a more flexible framework for foreign currency operations, by introducing the ""free convertibility"" of the local currency (Bolivar) and putting an end to many existing exchange restrictions.
According to the new exchange rules in force, private sector individuals and companies are free to carry out foreign currency transactions without having to request the intermediation of the BCV, which includes labour, services and procurement contracts, electronic payments and the possibility of entering into any transaction in foreign currency within the country.
 From 2 May 2019, Venezuela further relaxed its exchange procedures by adopting the Resolution 19-05-01 (O.G. 41.624), which authorises banking institutions to intermediate directly in the buying and selling of foreign currencies between individuals, companies and inter-banks transactions, by using their own exchange tables, with charges to foreign or local accounts in foreign currencies maintained in the national or international financial system. In this new scheme the operations with international organizations, diplomatic and consular representations are also allowed.
The BCV may carry out automatically sales operations of foreign currency to banks, when it deems appropriate, through unilateral debits in the accounts maintained by the respective banking institutions in the BCV, for the amount in bolivars equivalent to the exchange operation executed (Resolution 19-05-03; O.G. 41.640, dated on 24 May 2019).
 
The Central Bank interventions will be in accordance to the exchange rate policy, the reserve requirements ratios applied to banks (currently 57 % and marginal 100 %) and new exchange intermediation indexes adopted on 15 May 2019 (Resolution 19-05-02; O.G. 41.633). Therefore, the BCV will continue to have a determining role in the exchange rate valuation and in the path of depreciation of the local currency, even considering that the BCV is not committed to offer any foreign currency to the new system.
According to the information provided by foreign exchange operators, the BCV will publish on daily basis the weighted average exchange rate of the transactions traded at the bank exchange tables, which will be the new exchange rate of reference to the economy (Article 9 of Exchange Agreement No. 1).
Banks must sell to their clients through their respective exchange tables at least 80 % of the foreign currencies acquired, and the remaining 20 % may be used for inter-bank operations. The fulfilment of the Index of Exchange Intermediation (IEI) to the final customer will be measured on the last banking day of each week, based on the information corresponding to the daily flows. The BCV may modify the IEI when it deems appropriate.
Banking institutions may also maintain a weekly average amount in liquid foreign currencies, equal to or less than 30 % of the balance of the net availabilities in foreign currency held abroad by each banking institution as of 30 April, 2019. The BCV, when it deems appropriate, may modify this limit. The authorised exchange operators will not be able to process requests for the sale of foreign currency on behalf of their executives, shareholders, workers, attorneys, companies related, or affiliated. Financial institutions are not allowed to buy foreign currency for themselves.
 Regarding retail sell transactions equal or less than € 8 500 in cash and electronic transfers by operation can continue to be made through authorised exchange houses, as adopted on September 2018. The issuance and placement of securities denominated in foreign currency will continue within the Caracas Stock Exchange.
 Even with the recent and greater exchange flexibility generated by the legal changes, the shortages of foreign exchange will probably continue since the exchange tables are designed only to operate among private companies and individuals, and where the current supply is not enough to satisfy the country overall demand, especially to send back abroad dividends and capital investments regarding FDI and financial flows. Thus the exchange rate VES/EUR will continue to be under pressure. The exchange tables' scheme initiated on 13 May 2019 with an exchange rate of VES/EUR 5.914,58, resulting from four banks that participated in the debut (Venezuela, Nacional de Crédito, Exterior and BanCaribe). As of 31 May 2019, the reference exchange rate closed at VES/EUR 6.568.61, with a greater participation of banks, but with a depreciation of 11 % only in the first two weeks of implementation."

11161	False	Active	Thailand	Despite the government's repeated strong policy statements and occasional strong efforts in the field, the enforcement and administration of IPRs in Thailand remain inadequate in several respects. Physical counterfeiting and piracy continue to pose a serious and very visible problem in Thailand and although some progress has been made over time, effective protection of trademark rights and copyrights from infringement is far from guaranteed in Thailand. Ensuring an effective form of landlord liability could make a positive contribution in the fight against illicit trade but as of yet no specific measures to this end are being contemplated. The globally growing problems of copyright piracy and trademark counterfeiting on the Internet have emerged as new challenges, and in this context right holders have strong reservations about the efficiency of a recently introduced 'notice-and-takedown' procedure. In the field of patents, a major concern is the fact that after years of ineffectiveness in the substantive examination of patent applications the DIP is facing a formidable backlog. Although potentially positive signs have recently emerged, including e.g. an increase in the number of examiners, these measures may still take much time before they will have an effect on the considerable delays in patent examination and issuance, especially for complex chemical and pharmaceutical products.

Broad criteria for granting compulsory licences (even though only one compulsory licence has been granted recently, in 2012);
The absence of an effective system for protecting undisclosed test and other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products against unfair commercial use, as well as unauthorized disclosure;
Patent working requirement (Section 146 Patents Act and Form 27) – burden of annual submissions, legal uncertainty whether the working of a patent can be established also by importation; risk of compulsory licensing
Unclear scope of the Sept 2016 Office Memorandum concerning Section 31D of the Copyright Act: broadcasting vs. streaming.

 As for IPR enforcement:

Delays in registration of patents, GIs and trademarks, due to cumbersome procedures and weak manpower by IPR authorities;
Widespread piracy in the sectors of video gaming, music and movie industry;
Weak IPR enforcement, with insufficient action by relevant authorities to fight IPR infringements;
Backlogs in Civil Courts for IPR cases due to lack of specialised courts. The government is in the process of creating Commercial Courts for the judgement on, among other, IPR disputes;
EU stakeholders with standard essential patents face challenges in getting Indian ICT companies, in particular telecom equipment vendors, to pay due royalties;

- Until 2001 multilayer parquet panels were classified under HS Subheading 4418.30, free of duty.- In 2001, the US Customs Administration unilaterally reclassified parquet panels under 4412 (plywood), carrying an 8% import tax.- Strong opposition and protest by FEP and lobbying with the services of the EC (DG Taxud) followed.- In 2004, the HS Committee of the WCO (World Customs Organisation) by a large majority voted in favour of the classification of the product in question in subheading 4418.30, ergo exempting multilayer parquet of any US import duty.- The WCO, consequently, ratified this decision. However, the decision is not binding, hence the US Administration still had the possibility not to accept WCO ruling and to take the view that only a ruling of a competent US Court was binding in such a case.- A period of calm followed. Then, in September 2006, FEP received news about an important US Customs case against Kährs, one of the biggest FEP members, regarding multilayer imports, whereby the US Customs were not only claiming the 8% for the most recent shipments but were apparently also insisting on raising the duty retro-actively, i.e. going back to shipments of 2001. Kährs and FEP fought this ruling – together with the EC – and Kährs went to court in the US.- As of 1 January 2007, the WCO restructured the HS Classification, putting multilayer in 4418.72. This was merely an administrative change, to enhance transparency of international trade and related statistics.- However, FEP learned that US Customs Administration used this situation to maintain/officially install tariffs on parquet imports, particularly multilayer, i.e. the new classification code in the US became 4418.72.20, but the 8% import tax remaining obligatory.- As of 1 January 2017, the HS Classification is putting multilayer parquet in 4418.75.

Summary:

A GSO tyre-labelling scheme is in place since January 2016. KSA has an own tyre-labelling scheme, in implementation since November 2015. KSA ‘tolerates’ that tyres sold in KSA also bear the GSO label.


This situation is unnecessarily complex, costly and confusing for industry, consumers suffer the consequences. A  common GCC labelling scheme should be put in place. Limitation in time of GSO certificate to a one-year production period should be removed.

 
GCC – GSO Tyre labelling scheme
Minimum requirements and labelling of tyres: In implementation since Jan 2016
No legal text was ever published. Manufacturers are informed by GSO as things are decided/they find out whilst trying to access the market.
Both label and procedure to obtain it are becoming increasingly similar to the Saudi one.
Manufacturers are adapting their procedures accordingly, but the supply of the market has suffered some disruption.
The labelling process as well as the label are still being updated!
 
Saudi (SASO - Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organization) tyre labelling scheme
In implementation since November 2015. Legal text still changing.
Good cooperation with the EU through the TBT channel, but messy process (many different legal texts circulating at the same time).
Implementation also complicated and with delays.
Peculiar system whereby KSA is member of GSO and yet GSO labelling is not compulsory, KSA has its own labelling system.
-----
Different texts concerning minimum requirements for tyres and tyre labelling were notified to the TBT Committee under WTO notification numbers G/TBT/N/SAU/835 and G/TBT/WTO/N/SAU/907 on 16 July 2015 and 5 January 2016. In addition the ""Regulation for procedures of data registration and issuance of the energy efficiency labels in vehicles and tyres"" was shared with Industry but not notified.
The GSO is implementing its own tyre labelling and minimum requirement system. As Saudi Arabia is part of GCC and a member of GSO, tyre manufacturers exporting to Saudi Arabia fear they have to comply with double mandatory labelling systems. In practice, Saudi Arabia does not require the GCC marking but tolerates it
With regard to tyre minimum requirements and labelling systems, Industry has had the following concerns (most of them currently solved):
1). Snow tyres - the exemption for and definition of snow tyres was deleted.
2). Complementary references (Article 2) -All dates of REgulations have been deleted inthe latest versionof the text.
3). Definitions (Article 3) - C.1 tyres: The reference to N1 tyres should be reinstated. Tyre Type: The load designationshould be takenout of the definition of tyre type.4) Wet grip limits (Art 5 para 5.1.2 and table 2) - Industry would like a special allowance fr C2 Traction and Secial Use tyres.
5) Table 4a and 4b mentioned in para 5.2 - These are missing.
6). Label verificationprocedure - Industry would like a similar tolerance to the Wet Grip Index G as in EU legislation.
7). Laboratory alignment proceure With regard to reference laboratories Industry proposes refernce is made to Annex IVa of EU Reg. 1222/2009 and that Saudi labs. jointhe Europeqan network of labs.
8). Bar code and font of label size - Industry would like clarification on the correct label format. 
Industry also indicated that:
1). The final text of the Regulation was published in July 2015 and implemented from 1 November 2015 but subsequently modified again in January 2016 which led to significant logistical problems for Industry.
2). They would like C2 threshold implementation timings to be aligned with C3.
3). Industry would like the possibility to affix labels at point of sale rather than tyres having to have labels affixed at customs entry (unsolved issue)
4). Industry would like C3 tyres to be exempt from bearing physical stickers. (unsolved issue)
With regard to the ""Regulation for procedures of data registration and issuance of the energy efficiency labels in vehicles and tyres""

11003	False	Active	China	"The Chinese Compulsory Certification (CCC) system was first introduced in China in 2003 by the China National Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA). Despite some progress related to the implementation of the CCC, this remains a burdensome, expensive and time-consuming conformity assessment system, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Current requirements of the CCC system are not always related to the level of risk of the products, which implies that the CCC system is more trade restrictive than necessary.
The CCC touches many sectors such as automobiles, electrical/electronic products, machinery, ceramics and more recently ICT products. The system lacks flexibility and the same very heavy third-party certification procedure applies to very diverse categories of products, without any genuine consideration being given to the actual level of health and safety risk associated with them.
In 2013, CNCA officially said they had finished the review of CCC after 10 years’ practice and will announce some changes to CCC scheme according to the risk assessment results conducted in 2012.

(i) Products with lowest risk or not much relevant to safety would be removed from the CCC list
(ii) Products with low risk would have less test or conformity process
(iii) The frequency of factory inspection would be more flexible according to the risk assessment program based on the products and the capabilities of manufactures.
(iv) Products with High risk would be had more test or surveillance.
(v) Eight kinds of products have been removed from CCC scope in Aug. 2012.No. 117 CNCA 2012).

Following the adoption of the first two revised implementing rules for low voltage switch gears and for tyres, the implementing rules for the other product categories under the CCC are being systematically revised. Hence, more progress could hopefully be expected in the future on reducing the number of products subject to the CCC and simplifying certification procedures for lower risk products."

11403	False	Active	Malaysia	"In 2009, Malaysia removed the requirement for a Foreign Investment Committee (FIC) to screen proposed investments and repealed FIC Guidelines on the acquisition of interests, mergers, and takeovers, thereby reducing the minimum equity requirement for bumiputera in locally incorporated companies from 30 % to 12.5% for newly listed companies. With the abolishment of the Foreign Investment Committee, Malaysia removed its all-round foreign equity ceiling of 70%. Despite the fact that the general cap is removed, foreign equity restrictions remain in certain sectors. These are imposed by the different Ministries, rather than by a central body. Apart from formalized regulation on the matter, Ministries may also impose equity restrictions as a condition to obtain a license.
A separate set of regulations is imposed to reserve equity in businesses for ethnic Malays or Bumiputera. The rationale is to increase business participation of the Bumiputera. While ethnic Malays are the majority racial group in Malaysia, they are underrepresented in the country’s business community, which is largely made up of ethnic Chinese and Indians.
In these cases, the restrictions on foreign equity are not in favour of nationals of Malaysia, but ethnic Malay. In other words, a foreign invested company where the non-foreign equity is held by individuals who aren’t ethnically Malay would still fall foul of the law. The issue continues to be politically sensitive.
Areas which are subject Bumiputera reservations include banking and finance, water, batik production, agriculture, defense, energy and telecommunications.
Generally, investment in manufacturing is fully liberalised but investment in services remains subject to foreign equity caps in many sectors.
Nevertheless, the Government retains the authority to review and approve all investments by both domestic and foreign investors through the issuing of licences by the relevant Ministries, which generally enjoy full discretion in regard to licensing decisions. The licensing requirement applies to investment in manufacturing over RM 2.5 million, or having more than 75 employees. Licenses are required to carry out nearly all services activities. Foreign equity caps remain, notably for investment in telecommunications (70% for network services/facilities providers), oil and gas services (49%), insurance (70%), and transport. Foreign investment in newly privatised entities is limited to 25%. Malaysia makes extensive use of investment incentives and performance requirements are imposed on investors.

11021	False	Active	China	"Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in China is subject to a complex regulatory regime.
China classifies investment as being foreign or domestic. This dual approach is designed to serve industrial policies by placing conditionality on the opening of markets to FDI. Foreign companies can invest in China through three vehicles: equity joint ventures (EJV), contractual joint ventures (CJV) and wholly foreign owned enterprise (WFOE). This means that foreign companies have to take a different legal form than domestic companies which are subject to the China company law, and are subject to different and more stringent conditions, e.g. on the nationality of the CEO or the number of foreign national in the board of directors. 
In October 2016, a nation-wide reform on foreign investment was launched resulting in the removal of the requirement to obtain approval from MOFCOM or its local branches for projects which do not fall within a 'negative list' (a change from pre-approval to record-filing system).
FDI are also subject to the Catalogue of Industries for Guiding Foreign Investment, the so-called Foreign Investment Catalogue, adopted jointly by NDRC and MOFCOM. The Catalogue classifies investments in all key sectors according to three main categories: encouraged, restricted and prohibited. The encouraged category covers industries in which foreign investment is provided with the greatest flexibility and where the governmental interference is the lowest. Industries in this sector can also be subject to tax and other investment incentives. This category includes a number of high-tech and advanced manufacturing sectors, such as the for example aerospace or pollution control. The restricted category covers industries in which foreign investment is subject to a higher level of government scrutiny, limitations on the choice of corporate forms (such as mandatory joint ventures) and ownership ceilings. This category includes a number of sub-sectors within the services sector, including banking and insurance. Foreign investment in sectors listed under the prohibited category is simply not permitted at all. This category includes for example the domestic postal service. At the same time, industries which are not expressly listed in the Catalogue are deemed to be permitted. It should be noted, however, that the Catalogue is not exhaustive neither in terms of listing all existing barriers to foreign investment nor in terms of including all economic sectors.
Since the Foreign Investment Catalogue was first issued in 1995, it has been one of the most fundamental legal documents regulating foreign investment in China. On 28 June 2018, MOFCOM and the NDRC issued the 2018 Special Administrative Measures on Access to Foreign Investment (“2018 Negative list”), which replaced the list of restrictions and prohibitions in the 2017 foreign investment negative list, which was part of the broader Foreign Investment Catalogue of 2017. The “encouraged” section of that 2017 catalogue remains in effect even after the entry into force of the new negative list on 28 July 2017.
The 2017 Catalogue had 63 industries, which are either “restricted” or “prohibited” for foreign investment purpose. The 2018 Negative List shortened the list and now included 48 industries. Overall, the changes between the 2017 and 2018 foreign investment negative lists fall into one of the following two categories:

Market access openings: e.g. the removal of Chinese control requirements on crop breeding and seed production (except for wheat and corn);
Roadmaps/timelines for future market access openings: e.g. roadmaps for openings in the automobile manufacturing sector and the financial services industry.

Despite its importance, the Catalogue should not be considered the sole reference for foreign investors. Bans, limitations and additional requirements may also result from other mechanisms and laws, such as the National Security Review, the Anti-Monopoly Law or the Joint Venture Law. Other less tangible barriers exist due to cumbersome administrative and licensing procedures as well as local protectionism which can block potential investments altogether. This can be the case also if a given industry is included among the encouraged ones in the Catalogue—this explains why EU companies continue to feel significant restrictions even though some sectors are nominally opened to foreign investment.
In addition to this, the China State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) has released a list of industries where broad investment restrictions will apply and that should remain largely state-owned. For example, the State should solely own, or have a majority share in enterprises engaged in power generation and distribution, oil, petrochemicals and natural gas, telecommunications and armaments.
Many other laws contain restrictions or conditions on foreign investment including technology transfer requirements.
Apart from direct restrictions to investment, companies also suffer more indirect barriers due to measures such as targeted enforcement, local discretion or retroactive application of laws as well as unclear or discriminatory licensing procedures. Also, in approval processes, the requirements for foreign investors are often more burdensome, not transparent or known in advance. In 2014, the Commission has commissioned a study on investment restrictions in China (’Measures and practices restraining foreign investment in China’, 10.08.2014), which is published on DG Trade’s website."

Date and reference of the domestic legal act imposing the contested measure:

 

On 30.04.2018 the “UAE Technical Regulation for motor vehicle spare parts” came into force after having been posted in the ESMA Official Gazette. This new active regulation was not notified by the WTO and there is no translation of this regulation from Arabic language (attached).
Official deadline for implementation: postponed to 1 April 2019.

 

Factual description of the measure:

 
According to this new law, the UAE government has announced that as of 01.04.2019, vehicle car parts will need to be certified, registered and marked by ECAS (product certification scheme being implemented in the UAE by ESMA as mandated by Federal Law 28 of 2001) to enter the UAE market. It covers products that are manufactured inside the country and products imported from other countries. Non-registered products, which are already in the market, are allowed to be traded in UAE for a period of not more than 1 year after publication of this scheme in Official Gazette on 30.04.2018.
 
The conformity approval process is the following:

The supplier/manufacturer should register the products on the ESMA website under the ECAS scheme and sign the declaration of conformity;
Manufacturers shall comply with the following requirements for them to be granted an ECAS Certificate of Conformity:

Effective implementation of a management system according to the latest edition of ISO / TS 16949. This will be verified by ESMA and / or by an ESMA recognized competent conformity assessment body;
Product compliance to the relevant product standards mentioned in Annex 1. Any third party testing laboratory recognized by ESMA can verify and test the product. Test report date shall be not older than 3 years.


The Conformity Assessment process shall be conducted by ESMA or by ESMA recognized third party conformity assessment bodies.
When the result of the conformity assessment process showed that the factory and product comply with this technical regulation, a Certificate of Conformity and the Mark of Conformity shall be issued by ESMA.
The Certificate of Conformity is valid for three (3) years and is renewable.

 
The ECAS marking does not have to be in the spare part itself, as the ECAS registration will be checked via the barcode system. The labels (the barcode) would have to be present at the time of import (not only when distributed in the market).
 
Products having a GSO certification are for the moment not recognized.
 
In addition, EU manufacturers would like to raise the following concerns / requests regarding the technical regulation:

Provision of an official English version of the regulation, free of charge.
The scope should cover only new types of vehicles and their parts.
We assume the definition of OEM parts means the parts similar to genuine parts supplied by the supplier – called OES parts in Europe.
OEM and genuine parts should be exempted.
Confirmation of the product categories for which the registrations and markings are requested.
Components in stock, produced for servicing vehicles which are no longer produced, need to be exempted in order to be further used.
Manufacturers estimate that the adequate transitional period should be of at least 3 years as some molded markings may require a change in tooling.

 

Background information:

 

On 01.10.2015 ESMA (Emirates Authority for Standardization and Metrology) notified to WTO a draft of the Spare Parts Regulation under the following reference: G/TBT/N/ARE/268.
On 26.11.2015 the EU Commission commented this draft with some change requests.
After the second draft had been notified (attached) to the WTO, no activity had been noticed concerning the Regulation for Motor Vehicle Spare Parts in UAE.
Following the UAE notification of October 2018 the Delgation raised this issue with ESMA.
The issue will be raised at the next WTO TBT Committee.

Locally produced bottles will be taxed 80'000 IDR/litre (previously 75'000 IDR/litre), while imported ones 139'000 IDR/litre (before 130'000 IDR/litre). The applied tax rates discriminate against imported spirits for drinks >5% alcohol. 
 
 
3). In July 2015, the import tariff scheme for cider, class B alcoholic drinks, and class C alcoholic drinks was changed from a specific tariff to an ad valorem tariff following the issuance of Ministry of Finance Regulation No. 132/PMK.010/2015. The import tariff is set at 90% of the market price for cider and class B alcoholic drinks and at 150% for class C alcoholic drinks. This resulted in a steep increase in the unit price of imported wine and spirits, and widened the price gap between local and imported products. At the same time, the increase in import tariff creates higher incentives for illegal trade of alcoholic drinks in Indonesia.

Indonesia’s alcohol excise regime applies specific rates per volumetric litre in bands based on the alcohol content (alcohol-by-volume, or abv) of the product. The excise regime does not distinguish between beverage categories (i.e. beer, wine or spirits) or between beverage types within each category (i.e. whisky, vodka, gin, etc.).

Since 2016, unequal treatment of imported beers has been reported from several departments which adopted discriminatory provisions against imported beers through local legislation acts (ordenanzas, resolutions and circular notes). These measures include strip stamps, exclusively for imported beers, which result in higher costs and burdensome administrative procedures. Currently 11 departments (Caldas, Quindío, Tolima, Nariño, Norte de Santander, Cauca, Boyacá, Guajira, Caquetá, Casanare and Cesar) request strip stamps on each can of beer, whereas 4 departments (Santander, Risaralda, Meta and Huila) have mixed systems with strip stamps on each six-pack of beer. Following pressure to the Ministry of Trade, the Vice Minister of Trade sent a letter to the Federation of Departments requesting to address the issue in the affected departments. However, only 1 department (Atlántico) has lifted the measure so far.  This matter has been raised during the EU-Colombia Sub-Committee on Market Access (established under the Trade Agrement) on 8 December 2016. Colombia indicated that these departmental measures should be reviewed in line with national legislation and that it was currently reviewing possible actions. This matter has been raised at the subsequent 2017 and 2018 Sub-committees on Market Access but no progress has been registered.
In March 2018, Industry also brought to the EU's attention that according to industry affects them more than the exploitation charge. Importers are only allowed to deduct 15% of their promotion expenses from tax, while local licoreras have no such limit (this limit is incorporated in Lay 383 of 1997 adn Decree 416 of 2000).

Mid 2013 Russia introduced a ban on potatoes and plants for planting against the entire EU allegedly due to the absence of places or sites of production free of organisms considered as quarantine pests in Russia.
While for ware potatoes the ban is fully in place, for seed potatoes exports are possible (but declining) in the basis of a non-transparent pre-clearance system that includes inspections and sampling by Russian officials for each consignment or grower to be authorised to export once.

The draft says that national regime for foreign countries should apply under the conditions provided for by Russia's international treaties, and that the Russian Government could establish conditions for access of goods ands services originating in foreign countries to public procurement. 
The new law on Russia's federal contractual system was then adopted by the Russian Duma on 22 March 2013 in second reading, and signed by the President on 5 April 2013. The new law in Article 14 stipulates that national treatment will be extended to foreign goods and services if and only if a specific international agreement Russia is a party to explicitly says so. Furthermore, a list detailing such specific international agreements will be established and published by the competent Russian agency for public procurement. These rules are a deterioration of the situation of EU businesses in Russia compared to the status quo ante. Russia has committed itself to join the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and notify this intention to the WTO Government Procurement Committee at the time of accession. Russia would become an observer to the GPA and would initiate negotiations for membership within four years of its accession. Russian government agencies would, upon accession, award contracts in a transparent manner.

Light industry imports – Gov. Decree N 791 of 11.08.2014 'On establishing of a ban on access of light industry goods from foreign countries to public procurement'
Machinery and equipment – Gov. Decree N 84 of 31. 01.2015 'Amendments to the Gov. Decree N656 of 14 07.2014 
Pharmaceuticals – Gov. Decree N 1289 from 30 November 2015 introduces certain restrictions on public procurement of imported pharmaceuticals included in the list of crucially important pharmaceuticals
Software – Government Decree No 188 FZ of 29 June 2015 'On software and the procurement activities of government bodies'
Foodstuff – RU adopted Decree number 832 of 22 August 2016. ""On restrictions of admission of certain types of food products originating from foreign countries for the purposes of procurement for state and municipal needs"".

10560	False	Active	Russian Federation	"The Russian Federation rejects imports of live pigs and non-heat treated pig products and derivates from the whole EU since January 2014 (letters from Rosselkhoznadzor notified to the WTO SPS Committee refs G/SPS/N/RUS/48, G/SPS/N/RUS/49, G/SPS/N/RUS/64, G/SPS/N/RUS/76, G/SPS/N/RUS/142 and G/SPS/N/RUS/143).
Concerning up until December 2017 for Member States detecting cases of African Swine Fever (ASF) in their territory it issued relevant notifications of country-wide import bans to the WTO, specifying that the bans are based on the occurrence of the disease. For those Member States Russia also banned heat-treated products containing pig meat, with the exception of pet food. As regards the other EU Member States, Russia applied a de-facto ban of non-heat treated pig products linked to its refusal to accept the usual adaptations on agreed certificates following the occurrence of a disease, in order to exclude affected areas and allow free areas to continue exports.
The EU made intensive efforts to reach out to Russian authorities. When this proved fruitless, the EU opened a dispute settlement case in WTO in April 2014. The panel's report (August 2016) and the Appellate Body's report (February 2017) were both very favourable to the EU. The EU and Russia agreed on an implementation period by Russia ending on 6 December 2017.
The restriction is compounded by the political embargo imposed by Russia in August 2014, initially for one year but repeatedly extended and currently valid until the end of 2019. From the products affected by the ASF-ban, the political embargo initially covered pig meat but did not affect pig fat, offal and live pigs. This would mean when Russia modified its SPS measures to comply with the WTO ruling   as it (partially) did on 5 December 2017 (No. FS-NV-7/26504) export of pig fat and offal as well as of breeding pigs would resume from the areas of the EU it recognised as ASF-free. Out of the 1.4 billion € (2013 statistics) of affected exports by the ASF related sanitary ban about 400 million € (29%) represented pig offal, lard and fat. However, on 25 October 2017, Russia extended the scope of the political embargo by decree 1292 to animal offal and fat as well as to live pigs (except for breeding).
 WTO consultations on Russia's compliance were held in Geneva on 28 February 2018. As no solution was found, the EU requested a compliance panel in October 2018 to assess Russia’s compliance with the recommendations and rulings of the Appellate Body and the panel in 2017. The panel was composed in December 2018 and is expected to issue its final report in early 2020.

11406	False	Active	Colombia	"Colombia's truck scrappage policy was introduced in 2003 to tackle an alleged access of supply of heavy trucks in the country. The policy was modified frequently, but the fundamental problem consists in the 1 for 1 principle, which stipulates that a new truck can only be registered if an old truck is scrapped. As this policy only applies to trucks of 10.5t or more, 90% of which are imported, we consider this policy to be discriminatory and not in line with the national treatment principle of GATT and the Trade Agreement.
2016 saw important changes to the scrappage policy, mot notably the introduction of 'registration permits' issued free of charge by the Transport Ministry, which in theory would allow importers to register new trucks even if the same company has not older vehicles to scrap (Decree 1517 amending Decree 1079/2015). However, the policy is cumbersome, and companies are obliged to pay an additional fee of 15% of the value of the vehicle. In addition, a single supplier can only sell 4 trucks per month (although a waiver may be requested). Decree 1517 was supposed to lapse by the end of 2018, after which the market would be liberalised. However, the policy was prolonged until June 2019 in November 2018.
On April 12, 2019 a draft decree outlining the future policy was published. According to it, any 'normal' market transaction, i.e. purchase of a new truck, is no longer contingent on a formal procedure with the Transport Ministry. Colombia, therefore, fulfils its commitment to abolish the 1x1 scheme. However, the buyer would pay 15% of the value of the new vehicle (excl. VAT) as a contribution to the fund ""Fondo Nacional de Modernización del Parque Automotor de Carga"", which will provide incentives to owners of trucks older than 20 years, for the purpose of buying new ones. The decree will need to be complemented by a regulation which sets out further details. See attached document Ares(2019)2786103 for more information.

Le principal argument avancé par l’Egypte est la protection de l’industrie locale. Cet argument apparait fallacieux à plusieurs titres :
-           il n’existe pas d’entreprises produisant de la génétique aviaire en Egypte,
-           cette proposition de texte réglementaire intervient dans un contexte où les cours du canard ont été très bas au mois de novembre, comme c’est le cas chaque année. Un projet de texte réglementaire avait d’ailleurs déjà été proposé à la même époque l’an dernier. Il visait déjà à diminuer la densité d’animaux dans les élevages de canards à des niveaux très bas rendant l’élevage économiquement non viable, et à imposer une quarantaine au port à l’arrivée des canetons. Ce projet avait été abandonné suite à une intervention jointe des importateurs de canards et des accouveurs locaux, associés au syndicat des producteurs de volaille.
-           les importateurs importent des canetons d’un jour qui sont ensuite élevés sur place, par une main d’œuvre locale. Ils n’ont, tout comme les autres producteurs, aucun intérêt à ce que les cours soient bas et adaptent donc le niveau de leurs importations de canetons aux cours du marché. Au mois de novembre par exemple, certains importateurs ont très fortement réduit voire temporairement cessé leurs importations.

Licensing procedures in China restrict the access of foreign companies either through limiting licences for foreign companies or through mandatorily requiring licences that foreign companies often cannot attain. 
For financial services, the situation is as follows:
Insurance: China introduced a new Insurance Law which took effect on 31 August 2014. The new law has rectified a number of issues that were of concern to the EU industry and should be welcomed. However, while some progress has been made in transparency and market access, the industry continues to report a number of problems.
China s insurance regulator (CIRC) in the case of life insurance impose requirement on ownership structure for foreign insurers which can only operate in China through a Joint Venture (JV) with a 50% equity cap for the foreign investor.
On March 2013 CIRC released Administrative Measures on Market Access of Insurance Company Branch Office, aiming to standardize the approval process for the establishment of insurance company branches which on the paper does not establish a different treatment for foreign companies. However, de facto, market access is still affected and different treatment continues. We understand from stakehoders that normally foreign insurers can expect only one branch per year and per region to be approved by the regulator which is less favourable than what is granted to domestic insurers. Moreover, the process is still not transparent.
Banking: In January 2015, China amended the Administrative Regulations on Foreign Banks improving certain requirements regarding the opening of branches and licencing process including for RMB businesses. This amendment represents certain progress but it does not significantly ease foreign banks operations in China. Constrains for foreign banks are still high, The licensing processes for banks is still slow and intransparent with, overlapping responsibilities between the different regulators, Access to domestic bond underwriting is restricted and there are equity caps for acquiring a Chinese bank.

In accordance with the Order, the international road transport heading to the territory of the Russian Federation should be led via Ukraine or Baltic states. This would increase the transport costs for hauliers from Slovakia and other EU countries by approximately EUR 400 per route. At the same time, the waiting times at the remaining international border check-points of the Russian Federation would disproportionately increase. Moreover, many of these border check-points do not have facilities necessary for diverting all transport operations.

11412	False	Active	Paraguay	"The Representation law 194/93 regulates relations between foreign companies that export to Paraguay and local representatives / distributors in Paraguay. Under this law compensation has to be paid to the representative, when foreign exporters, without a justifiable reason, cancel, revoke, modify or do not renew their contract with a local representative / distributor in Paraguay. The amount of compensation is set through the judiciary or through arbitration. The law provides only broad criteria, leaving much to the discretion of the courts, which creates a situation of legal uncertainty for European exporters. There is a current legal draft in discussion to reinforce even more the protection of local representatives / distributors.
 
Background
The Representation law (Law No. 194 of 6 July 1993, which replaced the Decreto-Ley 7 of 27 March 1991), establishes the legal framework governing relationships between foreign companies that export to Paraguay and their Paraguayan representatives. The law requires that exporters to Paraguay prove just cause when they terminate, modify or fail to renew contracts with Paraguayan distributors or agents. If such a relationship is ended without proving just cause, the foreign company must pay its representative an indemnity, which is not fixed in the law. This is giving rise to broad discretional criteria of the court to fix this amount, which creates a situation of legal uncertainty for foreign firms. It seems that in some cases foreign companies paid large sums when ending distribution relationships in Paraguay to avoid lengthy court cases or have maintained ineffective representatives to avoid such payments.
Under Law 194/93, the amount of compensation is set through the judiciary or arbitration based on (1) the length of the agreement and (2) the gross earnings of the representative / distributor. All foreign exporters / importers can cancel, revoke, modify or not renew their contract with the local representative/distributor without paying compensation provided there is a justified reason for it, notably one of the following:a. breach of the contract;b. fraud or abuse of trust in the duties entrusted;c. ineptitude or negligence;d. any act imputable to the representative/distributor, which results in damage to the sales, distribution etc.;e. conflict of interest.
Before claiming any of the above the exporter shall ask the representative / distributor to solve the problem within 120 days. Following this period, the exporter can claim its rights immediately except in cases of fraud or abuse of trust. The importer should make its claim before the judiciary or through arbitration, otherwise unjustified reasons will be assumed. In the event of cancellation, irrespective of the compensation awarded, the representative / distributor has the right to sell the existing stock to the exporter at market price (i.e. including profit).
The agreement between importer and representative/distributor can be demonstrated by one or more of the following:- Authorising letter to manage the local market.- Bills that demonstrate trading deals between the parties.- Payment for a commission to the representative / distributor for trading deals during at least the last two years before the entry into force of this law.- Advertising and publicity expenses claiming the representative/distributor role, the importer being aware of it and not opposing it.- Claims by representative / distributor of commissions for operations not done through him, which have been paid by the importer.
This legal uncertainty has the effect of deterring EU companies from exporting to Paraguay. These restrictions could deny the Paraguayan economy inputs that are necessary for its development. In addition, by offering disproportionate protection to local operators, beyond their legitimate needs, the law protects and rewards inefficiency, which does not serve the interests of the Paraguayan economy.The termination indemnities and other requirements apply only to foreign suppliers. Local suppliers are not obliged under this law or under similar conditions regarding the relationships with distributors or agents."

The procedure adds significant costs without offering additional compliance assurance from an enforcement perspective.

After the suspension of this policy by the Prime Minister's Office on 8 July 2013, a new preference policy was adopted for electronic products in Government procurement on 23 December 2013, which eliminates security as a reason for preferences. Furthermore, this new PMA policy is limited to government procurement only, and not extended to private purchases. Local content and value addition requirements for government procurement, however, remain the same. A series of implementation notifications followed. A new preference policy for telecoms is still outstanding (together with implementing guidelines). On 29 August 2018, India issued a new notification, increasing the scope of the measure: The original PMA from 2012 reserved 100% preferences for 19 out of 23 telecom products listed.  In the new policy a total of 36 telecom products is listed; for 12 products PMA is at 100%. This policy will be applicable on projects funded by the central government.
Renewable energy – solar power plants: the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission laid down local content requirements for solar power plants. The Solar Mission is to be implemented in three phases; the third phase will end in 2022. The first round of selection of projects took place in 2010-2011 based on certain local content requirements (e.g. use of cells and/or modules manufactured in India for solar PV projects). Phase 2 was launched in October 2013 mandating a domestic content requirement: out of the total capacity of 750 MW, 50% (so 375 MW) was kept for bidding with Domestic Content Requirement (DCR). Under DCR, 100% of the solar cells, modules and thin films used in the solar PV power plants must both be made in India. The US challenged this programme at WTO: in August 2015, the panel found that DCR measures were not justified. A notice of appeal has been filed by the Indian government. The DCR is also proving an obstacle to the development of local solar power production because India's manufacturing capacity is low, more expensive than foreign imports and of a lesser quality.
Iron and steel products: As part of PM Modi's ""Make in India"" Strategy, on 3 May 2017 the Cabinet approved a policy for the use of domestic steel products in government organisations.  The policy makes it mandatory to give preference to Domestically Manufactured Iron and Steel Products (DMI&SP) in government procurement.

Designed to secure critical Chinese infrastructure information systems, the initial MLPS is a framework that classifies information systems physically located in China according to their relative impact on national security, social order, and economic interests if the system is damaged or attacked. The classification levels range from one to five, one being the least critical and five being the most critical. Information systems that are classified (initially self-assessed and proposed by operators and then confirmed by MPS) at level 3 or above are subject to enhanced security requirements, resulting in the de facto exclusion of foreign companies from those levels.

The Regulation aims to implement Article 21 of the Cybersecurity Law and further builds on the Administrative Measures for Information Security Multi-level Protection from 2007.

The industry's difficult situation has been aggravated by the MoHW's implementation (as of January 2014) of the revised Price-Volume Agreement (PVA) of which the scope will be expanded to provide for further cuts in pricing (the claimed amount increases by more than 10% and the annual billing amount increases over 5 billion won).
In December 2014 the MoHW made some improvements aiming at facilitating patients' accessibility to new drugs by : i) procedural improvements for new drug listing through the introduction of ""fast-track""; ii) exemption of pharmaco-economic assessment for pricing of drugs for rare diseases and certain cancer; iii) introduction of refunding system for a limited number of drugs.

While the objective to stengthen its cyber legislation is not in itself fundamentally dissimilar to what is happening ain other jurisdictions, the concept of cybersecurity is primarily seen in China from a national security perspective and has a much wider and comprehensive definition, also including economic security and industrial policy considerations.
The law and the implementing regulations are vaguely worded and thus create ample discretionary margin at the implementation level. This leaves in particular the foreign businesses in insecurity over the intent and scope of the measures put in place.

State Council decided in May 2016 to deregulate the domestic salt industry in a bid to improve efficiency of state owned enterprises. Order number 696 (26 December 2017) and the MIIT rules and procedures (4 May 2018) allowed to regulate the situation and enabled producers of salt sell their products directly instead of going through a state owned company. The rules provide that only designated salt wholesale companies can retail salt in China. Designated salt producers need to have a licence to produce edible salt, establish records and label the salt according to regulations; also wholesalers must be designated and obtain licenses. The legislation does not refer to [imports from] third countries.
The rules of procedure published by the MIIT are unclear for foreign companies, who are seeking to better understand how to proceed and whether they can be designated and how.
As a result, all imports of salt have effectively been stopped by Chinese customs.

(i) The introduction of an import ban for 24 types of waste notified (G/TBT/N/CHN/1211) to the WTO TBT Committee in July 2017, which entered into force 1.1.2018. It covers plastic, certain paper, metals, textiles etc. China to gradually discontinue other waste imports until the end of 2019. China notified the WTO of these measures on 18 July 2017, citing environmental concerns as the justification. The consultation was open for two days rather than the required 60. The WTO notification can be found here: https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/FE_Search/FE_S_S009-DP.aspx?language=E&CatalogueIdList=237742,237691,237702,237703,237688,237701,237712,237713,237704,237715&CurrentCatalogueIdIndex=4&FullTextHash=371857150&HasEnglishRecord=True&HasFrenchRecord=False&HasSpanishRecord=False
(ii) A batch of standards for imported waste as secondary raw materials, notified in November 2017 (G/TBT/N/CHN/1224-1234) which entered into force in March 2018. It affects slag for iron or steel production, waste iron or steel waste, non-ferrous metals waste, vessels for breaking up, paperboard waste and scrap, fuel wood, wood waste, cork, cork waste, plastic waste and scrap automobile.
(iii) On April 19, 2018, China announced Adjustment of Imported Waste Administration Catalogue which moved 16 categories of solid waste (i.e. metal and electrical appliance scraps, waste vessels, compressed piece of scrap automobile, smelt slag, and waste plastic from industrial sources) to the Catalogue of Prohibited Solid Waste Import entering into force on 31 December 2018. - a measure that was not notified to the TBT. Further 16 categories of solid wastes (i.e. scrap of stainless steel, scrap of titanium, wood waste) were moved to the Catalogue of Prohibited Solid Waste Import entering into force on 31 December 2019. – also not notified.
Two extra notices were issued in 2018 related to waste import ban. First one is the notice to put scrap metals from ""Restricted "" to ""Ban"" for importing from July, 2019. Second one relates to how to proceed on the definition of the waste categories once there occurs ""waste or material"" dispute at the port.
In August 2018  a new draft law was introduced, not in force yet, prohibitng the import of all solid waste (new article 29).
 
In early January 2019, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE), Ministry of Commerce (MofCOM), National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), General Administration of Customs (GAC)  jointly issued an ‘Announcement on adjusting “Imported waste management catalogue”‘ in accordance with Solid Waste Pollution Prevention and Control Law and ‘Solid waste import management measures’ (环办土壤函[2016]2289号).
 The policy adds eight more solid waste products to be banned from import, effective 1 July 2019, including

copper scrap
aluminium scrap
iron and steel scrap

 The Announcement also confirmed also that China aims to ban entry of all solid waste by end 2020.

Under the system of surveillance by registration, all EU exports to Turkey are required to register with ITKIB by filling out forms as a prerequisite to import footwear and apparel products. With this new measure, companies importing footwear and apparel products ofrom China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Cambodia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand origin are now required to submit an additional documentation and information on risk basis.
The Exporter Producer Information Form is required in case the concerned importer firms cannot meet the risk criteria relating to production, export, import and employment data. It is not clear what exactly this risk refers to and what the required conditions are.
This new requirement imposes burdensome and far-reaching requirements on EU operators purchasing from Asian vendors and is expected to have a significant adverse impact on concerned industries.

12040	False	Active	United States of America	"US cabotage restrictions are the effect of various provisions contained in US legislation and regulations, often collectively (and to a certain extent erroneously) referred to simply as the ""Jones Act""[1]. Such legislative measures were enacted as from 1920 with the objective of ensuring the maintaining of a national fleet designed to protect American national defence (and - at the time - to allow for the selling of superfluous cargo ships built during WWI). There are clear indications that the economics are not in favour of the Jones Act. However, it creates and preserves jobs for the constituents and therefore gains bipartisan support. Moreover, whilst the economic benefits of the Jones Act are concentrated, the costs are diffuse. This explains why the several attempts made over a century to render such rules less restrictive have all failed. For maritime commercial entities to be able to benefit from the exclusive opportunities offered to them by the Jones Act and relating cabotage legislation (e.g. operation of US coastal trading and relating services), the vessels that they operate must be: US built, US owned, US maintained, and US crewed; furthermore, maritime commercial entities must be US controlled. It should be noted that cabotage legislation which restricts maritime transportation between ports of the same country is common everywhere in the world (and to a certain extent also in the EU). What makes the US legislation peculiar and unduly restrictive is the fact that domestic transportation - even when carried out by US operators - can only be performed by using vessels which are US built, US owned/controlled, US crewed and US maintained. These requirements, add to the effects of traditional cabotage measures important limitations in terms of shipbuilding (because no foreign built ship can be used), establishment (because only companies owned and controlled by Americans can carry out coastal trade services) and repair services (because vessels repaired/reconverted outside the US risk losing the necessary qualifications to operate again within US waters).
 
[1] The Jones Act is detailed as Chapter 24 (Merchant Marine Act, 1920) of the Appendix to Title 46 (Shipping) of the United States Code. The Code is the codification by subject matter of the general and permanent laws of the United States, published every six years (since 1926) by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Subsequently, 18 products were added through different Orders taking the total number of products to 38. The BIS certification procedure adds to additional burden and costs for EU steel companies for obtaining certification, which implies additional tests for products, which have already been tested.
The latest situation is that India on 13 August 2018, came out with the Steel and Steel Products (Quality Control) Order, 2018 wherein it notified 54 products. One standard (IS 7904:1995) cease to exist after 18 November 2018. 5 standards (IS 4454 (Part I) : 2001, IS 4454 (Part II) : 2001, IS 4824 : 2006, IS 11169 (Part I) : 1984 and IS 6603 : 2001) have been kept outside the purview of this Order till 17 February 2019 and IS 7904 : 2017 shall come into effect from 19.2.2019.
India explained at the WTO TBT Committee that the BIS standards are required in order to take into account manufacturing practices of India and therefore international standards are not sufficient.
Not only does India impose BIS-specific standards, in addition testing is to be performed locally (in-country testing): India should at least accept that tests can be carried out in foreign accredited laboratories attesting compliance with ISO standards (or BIS Indian standards) thus not requiring local testing in India for all types of steel products, and not to conduct factory inspections in the EU steel mills having in place a quality management system as defined in ISO 9001.

However, this regulation excludes some products such as: milk and dairy products, semen and bovine embryos, sebum without protein, di-calcium phosphate, hides and skins, gelatine and collagen. Also, veterinary products not elaborated with risk products identified in Terrestrial Animal Health Code, as long as these products come from animals of negligible risk, as well the feed for felines and canines which comply with the same requirements, are allowed. Deboned bovine meat of animal less 30 months of age is allowed complying with several conditions.
In addition, for de-bone fresh meat and meat products from cattle, the OIE code states that not import conditions should be set regardless of the BSE status of the exporting country and therefore it can be exported from BSE affected countries following compliance with certain certifications requirements.

Registration: Refer to Ministerial Decree No.43/2016 

Mandatory registration of companies in order to create a registry of factories exporting certain products (agricultural products, cosmetics, toys, textiles and garments) to Egypt. The Decree entered into force on 16 March 2016. Among the documents required for the registration, the Decree includes a certificate that the producer and/or the trademark owner maintain ""a quality control system."" All the documents to be provided have to be certified by a Chamber of Commerce, approved by an Egyptian embassy and translated by an accredited translation centre.

EBCA mentioned that their members (international brands) work with a network of trusted vendors, and that they would have to submit hundreds of requests.
Certificates of Inspection: Refer to Decree No. 991 /2015 

certificates of inspections will be mandatory for custom release (tests and inspection to match Egyptian standards). Regarding specifically cosmetics, the safety of cosmetics products is already regulated by the Ministry of Health. Therefore cosmetics products should be exempted of this certification. This dual procedure will create huge administrative and economic burden without any gain for the consumer safety.

12641	False	Active	Norway	EU export possibilities in PAPs products to Norway remain significantly constrained by high custom tariffs based on the EEA Agreement, Protocol 3. Despite the fact that the Protocol foresees annual consultations to make sure that the terms are adapted to market developments and new concessions, there have been only two adaptations since the entry into force of the EEA Agreement in 1994. Even if the EEA Agreement maintains specific arrangements for PAPs, the spirit of the EEA Agreement is to integrate markets at regional level. Norway should therefore firmly engage in negotiations to review the Protocol 3 towards the aim of further liberalising trade in PAPs.

Regionalization exists to ensure that safe trade occurs from disease-free regions/zones within the exporting countries and that trade is not the cause of the spread of diseases in the importing countries. In the EU internal market and equally for exports to non-EU countries, the European Commission, EU Member States and business operators apply the principle of regionalisation very seriously as a means to support trade while protecting the livestock from contagious animal diseases like ASF.
The EU acknowledges that exchanging technical information about animal diseases or cooperating shall not prevent any non-EU country or the EU from establishing the level of protection they both deem as appropriate, in accordance with the WTO SPS Agreement. In addition, the EU considers that WTO Members have to select risk management options that are not more trade restrictive than necessary.
Australia informed that imports into Australia of some porcine-derived products will be able to continue under existing arrangements, where country freedom from ASF in all pigs is not required, or where products are able to meet alternative risk mitigation measures for ASF.

Kazhakstan and Russia notified to the WTO under the TBT Agreement on 8 July 2016 the Draft Amendment No.2 to the Technical Regulation of the Customs Union “On Safety of Toys” (CU TR 008/2011), proposed by Kazakhstan itself. The measure introduces psychological and pedagogical criteria for imported toys, whcih appear to bear no relation with actual toy safety. The EU responded in written comments in September 2016, noting that the proposed introduction of such requirements  is unprecedented in international practice. The EU asked for the scientific basis, such as behavioural studies, justifying the need for such requirements. The measure has so far been postponed and the latest contacts we had with the Eurasian Economic Union (letter from Autumn 2018 - 14 November 2018) indicated that EU's comments are taken into account.

The measure introduces psychological and pedagogical criteria for imported toys, whcih appear to bear no relation with actual toy safety. The EU responded in written comments in September 2016, noting that the proposed introduction of such requirements  is unprecedented in international practice. The EU asked for the scientific basis, such as behavioural studies, justifying the need for such requirements. The measure has so far been postponed and the latest contacts we had with the Eurasian Economic Union (letter from Autumn 2018 - 14 November 2018) indicated that EU's comments are taken into account.

As of June 2017, some of these products also need to meet a new more stringent conformity assessment procedure for EMI/EMC certification (Electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic compatibility) from the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) in the form of a Certificate of Conformity (CoC).




 


Energy efficiency certification and labelling


Safety and energy saving certification 


Electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/ECM)




Scope


Electrical and electronic apparatus


Electrical and electronic apparatus


Non-telecommunications electronic and electrical equipment and products




Legislation


New in 2015: Compulsory specifications - VC 9008  (SANS 941 This standard covers energy efficiency requirements (minimum energy performance standard MEP), measurement methods and mandatory energy efficiency labelling)
https://www.nrcs.org.za/siteimgs/vc/VC9008.pdf


Compulsory specifications - VC 8055 plus a broad array of applicable Standards issued by SANS for each type of product: https://www.nrcs.org.za/siteimgs/vc/VC8055.pdf


1 June 2017, SA legislation 'Modification of the South African Bureau of Standards Program on Issuance of Certificates of Compliance Related to Electromagnetic Compatibility for Manufacturers' imposes a new more stringent conformity assessment procedure for EMI/EMC regulations already in place: ICASA General Notice 46-2010 ‘Regulations in Respect of Technical Standards for Electronic Communication Equipment’ 
Measure was notified to WTO after its implementation (September 2017)




Equivalence of standards


Standards by different standardization bodies such as ISO, IEC and EN, will be accepted if it is proven, in the form of a declaration report from an accredited conformity assessment body*, that they are technically equivalent to the relevant SA National Standard. The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining such a declaration report.
*Be from a laboratory accredited by a national accreditation body affiliated to the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC), the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), and/or be an IECEE CB Scheme member (Operated by the IEC System of Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechical Equipment and Components (IECEE). The IECEE CB Scheme is an international system for mutual acceptance of test reports and certificates dealing with the safety of electrical and electronic components, equipment and products.


No equivalence. International certification schemes like ILAC or IECEE CB-FCS schemes are not accepted by SABS.




Testing


SABS set the national standards and test procedures for the appliances.
 
Accredited in-house, national and international laboratory testing allowed. As long as testing is from a laboratory accredited by a national accreditation body affiliated to ILAC and/or be an IECEE CB Scheme member.
 
SABS also provides the facilities to test appliances.
For energy efficiency SABS is planning to have an effective testing facility early 2019 after failed attempt in 2017.


Only in SABS accredited third party laboratories.
 
Since December 2018:1 lab in SA and 2 labs in Europe
In addition 36 in Asia, 7 in the US.




Verification


The NRCS is the regulatory body charged with verifying compliance with the compulsory specifications by issuing a Letter of Authority. Safety/energy saving and energy efficiency are evaluated simultaneously.


SABS is responsible for the issuance of Certificates of Compliance (CoCs).
System remains manual despite announcing already in 2017 that it would be online.
EMC/I compliance must be confirmed before issuing an LoA by NRCS.




 
Products: the products that seem to be covered by the conformity assessment procedure for energy efficiency and electromagnetic compatibility are low risk electrical equipment.
Standards: not based on essential requirements but on specific technical requirements for each product, this makes the system burdensome and complicates finding equivalent international standards, in particular for energy efficiency as EU accepts self-regulation based on a common standard that is very different –in fact more onerous - from SAs requirements.
Testing: Accredited in-house, national and international laboratory testing allowed for obtaining LoAs but there have been delays in establishing South African testing facilities for energy efficiency standards since 2017.
For obtaining EMC/EMI CoCs only testing allowed is from accredited SABS third party laboratories (SABS A-Lab) Program) for which there is no ILAC Mutual Recognition Arrangement. There is a non-refundable application fee for laboratories of R 189,951 for year 1 and then a subsequent payment of R 94,969 for year 2 and another R 94,969 for year 3. In addition, laboratories established outside South Africa (for example in Europe) will be obliged to incur extra unnecessary costs, compared to a local laboratory, e.g. air flight and accommodation and local travelling costs for the South African assessors must also be covered. Moreover a non-refundable certification fee of R 16,000 is payable by the manufacturer per application submitted (covers 4 products).
Verification: Conformity assessment procedures in place for both certifications remain manual processes and not risk based. Lead time at SABS is established at 30 working days, while NRCS has established a target of 120 days. This means that in the best scenario an electronic or electrical product requiring both certifications cannot expect place their products in the market before 5-6 months, irrespective of their origin and risk profile. The current manual process also lends itself to lack of transparency, consistency and predictability.
The EU believes that some of the different elements of the conformity assessment system for electrical and electronic products constitute a barrier to trade.
The EU believes that mandatory certification by national conformity bodies (NRCS/SABS) is stricter than necessary given the risk profile of the products. The EU understands as well that it is the prerogative of the South African government to impose a pre-market conformity assessment procedure based on a mandatory certification system. Nonetheless, the EU believes that some of the different elements of the system constitute a barrier to trade.
There is no justification for not accepting international standards, and if accepted the burden of proof on the manufacturer is excessive. SA standards should be brought into conformance whenever possible with the international standard.
There is no justification of rejecting results (test or inspection reports, certificates) which have been issued under internationally recognized systems like the IEC schemes (IEC CB) or by conformity assessment bodies (CABs) which have been accredited under a Multinational Recognition Arrangement like ILAC and IEC CB, of which South Africa is a signatory.
The cost of compliance in terms of money and time is excessive and disproportionate given the risks associated with noncompliance.

the obligation to rotate the health warnings, as it may constitute an excessive burden for SMEs,
the lack of clarity about the size of the health warning, which is defined in relation with the total size of the container. Should the measure lead to an excessive size of the warning, it could lead to the production of a new label or extra label, tailored to the South African particular requirements, which is too burdensome for exporting companies.

11820	False	Active	China	"In December 2013, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information (MIIT) issued the Chinese Shipbuilding Scrapping & Newbuilding Subsidy Programme. The scheme is endowed with €19,5 billion RMB (according to SEA Europe) and was originally running until 2015. It was later extended until 2017. While it may since have been discontinued, as of January 2019 the Chinese authorities had not provided definitive confirmation of this despite EU requests, while some EU industry participants believe it is still operating. There are no official data available on the exact figures and conditions of the scheme.
The objective indicated by the Chinese authorities is to phase out obsolete vessels and replace them by more energy efficient ships and, thus, protect the environment/climate and enhance their fleet's safety standards.
Beneficiaries receive a subsidy of 1500 RMB/GT – 50% is paid on scrapping the old vessel (1-10 years before their mandatory retirement age), 50% on ordering the new vessel. According to the ""Administration of Central Government Subsidies for the Scrapping of Outdated Ships and Single-hulled Oil Tankers and the Rebuilding of New Ships"" Cai Jian (2014) no 24 the gross tonnage of the newly-built ships should be at least equivalent to that of the disassembled vessels. However, at the EU-China Shipbuilding Dialogue 2014 in Shanghai, MIIT declared that there is no automatic link between scrapping and newbuilding. The vessels must be registered in China and the newbuilding has to take place on a Chinese shipyard. A list of qualified Chinese shipyards entitled to participate was published. The main beneficiaries of the programme are the four state owned shipowners: COSCO, CSG, SINOTRANS-Chang Jing and China Merchant. Foreign equipment manufacturers are apparently allowed to participate subject to complying with certain conditions.
 Conditions for foreign equipment manufacturers: 

the percentage of ""local"" marine equipment must be at least 70%;
""local"" supply refers only to manufacturing companies. Sales offices of a foreign marine equipment supplier do not qualify as local suppliers;
wholly foreign owned manufacturing companies established in China do not qualify as local suppliers either;
in case of Joint Ventures, the Chinese partner has to be the major shareholder. 

These restrictions do not appear to have been written down in any formal document. At the EU-China Shipbuilding Dialogue 2014, MIIT declared to have no influence on sourcing maritime equipment. It would be the shipowner's decision. Accordingly, the local content policy is implemented through an arrangement between the shipowner, the shipyard and China Classification Society (CCS) by means of a list of equipment. This not publicly available list attributes a weighting factor to each major component (i.e. 38,5% is attributed to the engines) for calculation of the 70% local content. As a result, a European engine manufacturer can never sell engines to these subsidized ships, regardless of whether they have factories in China or not.

12301	False	Active	South Africa	"SA authorities take several years to evaluate questionnaires used in the negotiations of import permits and health certificates by new applicants (such as in the case of a number of EU MS). For pork and other meats, SA operates a queue system with no indication of duration for the handling of the application. SA authorities affirm that delays are due to lack of resources and that no applicant is treated more favourably than others.
With regards to pork, the process has been particular slow and restrictive due to SA rules on PRRS control. PL questionnaires have been validated in 2016, while discussions commenced in 2004. The final report is being completed and draft health certificates are being finalised. The queue currently comprises AT, SE and FI. AT has been waiting for more than four years. In the case of SE and FI (which are PRRS free according to OIE), SA has explained that declaration of freedom may have a positive impact only when the assessment starts but would not warrant fast-tracking because Sweden and Finland, being part of the EU market, are exposed to free circulation from other EU MS.
Regarding poultry, Lithuania has applied for import of poultry and poultry products in 2012 and still waiting.
Regarding beef, contrary to reassurances by SA, new health certificates are not yet available to Member States whose BSE status under OIE has improved and despite the fact that SA's cabinet has authorised DAFF to issue them. DAFF indicated further information might be required on use of animal protein and slaughterhouses. Application for IT Bresaola has been pending for a long time – IT has been number 8 on the list for 3 years now. The SA authorities consider Bresaola to be fresh meat – resulting from a dispute on the temperatures for treatment. DAFF requires 70 degrees, which also poses issues with mortadella.
SA also insists that the EU needs to explain how BSE and other EU SPS controls are addressed in intra-community trade. SA requires information on how EU MS with different risk profiles manage imports among them and monitor exports to third countries which may ensue. As long as such explanation is provided, BSE status of all EU countries will be kept at levels which may be higher than the ones claimed individually under OIE and a declaration of freedom would have limited, if any impact. The SA authorities (DAFF) had told France that a mission to the EU would be sent to look into the issue.
With regards to poultry, DAFF is refusing to resume imports from the NL after declaration of freedom from HPAI, contrary to past practice. In a letter to industry, reference is made to the ""plight of the (local poultry) industry"" (which has already led to the imposition of antidumping and provisional safeguard duties). It would thus appear that SPS issues are going to be used as trade defence measures. DAFF has announced intention to go to a fact finding mission to EU MS to verify freedom.

The EU has no Free Trade Agreement with Venezuela.
On the one hand, there is the Organic Law of Fair Prices (O.G. 40787 of 12/11/2015), which establishes controls on pricing goods and services commercialised within the Venezuelan market, including imported goods, by the Superintendence for the Defense of Socioeconomic Rights (SUNDDE), which fixes the selling prices, as well as of the all cost structures components. Also rules the limits to the profits of producers and importers.
On the other hand, there is the Constitutional Law on Agreed Prices (O.G (e) 6342 of 22/11/2017), which establishes an additional mechanism for determining the prices of goods and services that the Government considers prioritised. This mechanism is controlled by the Government and involves negotiations with the different competent entities of the public sector, as well as price inspections by the communal power bodies and the Productive Workers' Councils. The Government reserves the right to incorporate any good or service into this price control system.
This legal framework establishes that every single person or company dedicated to the commercialisation of goods and services must be registered in the Unique Registry of Individuals and Companies that Develop Economic and Commercial Activities (RUPDAE), which is also mandatory for companies dedicated to the international trade.
The prices are fixed in three categories: i) the Fair Sale Price (PVJ), determined exclusively by the SUNDDE, ii) the Maximum Retail Price (PMVP), which may be determined by the producer or importer with a margin of net profit no more than the 30% over the cost structure, or unilaterally fixed by the SUNDDE, and, iii) Agreed Prices, resulting from the negotiation between producers, importers and the Government. In all these modalities, the prices may be fixed at the discretion of the Government when special circumstances or the general and social interest prevail.
The cost structures of these three pricing modalities must also be authorised by the Government. In the cases of the PVJ and the PMVP the updates will be made through the reference values of the System of Regular Price Adjustment (SACP). In terms of the Agreed Prices, through the methodology established by the Law in the Informatics System of Price Management.
Market access is also controlled by SUNDDE. The possibility of incorporating products or services into the domestic market must be previously authorised by this body, which will perform all the procedures for determining and fixing retail prices prior to marketing within the country.
The price control system is supported by a regime of sanctions, which includes the occupation for 180 days, extendable, of the establishments and warehouses, the suspension from 3 to 10 years in the RUPDAE, the seizure of the goods, the revocation of permits and licenses, the application of fines between 500 and 50,000 tax units (VES 17 per UT as of 11/9/2018, adjustable  O.G. 41479), and/or prison between 3 to 15 years for crimes of usury, speculation, fraudulent alteration, hoarding, boycott, destabilisation of the economy, resale of products, among others.
The SUNDEE was attached to a new Ministry of Internal Commerce, created on September 11, 2018 (O.G 41479). This ministry will exercise the stewardship of the internal trade plans and and a stronger  surveillance of the overall domestic commerce activities."

12340	False	Active	Venezuela	"Under the framework of the Exchange Control Regime in force since 2003 the presentation of the Non Production or Insufficiency of National Production Certificate is required for the achievement of formalities regarding imports at Foreign Trade Centre (CENCOEX) and also with Integrated Customs and Tax Administration Service (SENIAT)
The Non Production or Insufficiency of National Production Certificates are required by CENCOEX to apply for acquisition (ADD) and settlement (ALD) of preferential foreign exchanges intended to import goods consumer, industrials, raw materials and for the exoneration of customs taxes to SENIAT.
The ""Certificate of National Non-Production"" applies where the merchandise is not available in national territory, while the ""Certificate of Underproduction"" is required when the merchandise assumed to be insufficient to supply the domestic market.
The way to obtain these certificates entails an extensive list of requirements, which are required by issuer's ministries, depending of the goods that are going to be imported. The procedure is so complex and discretional that has limited severely the foreign trade.
The approval and granting of the Certificate also does not necessarily imply authorisation of the requested import quantities. Most of the time, import quantities are substantially lower than the requests made.
Certificates are valid for six (6) months from the date of issue and the amounts specified therein, which constitutes a quantitative restriction on trade. Each user is expected to perform one (1) request per semester (not boarding), adding in the same plan all the products to be imported into the same time frame.
Official Gazette Nº 39.980 of August 7, 2012, establishes that only 1.013 Tariff Codes do not require the certificate of Non Production (List 1), which basically only apply to some food products and essential medicines, while the number of tariff codes that require the certificates (list 2) reaches 5.881 (5,8 times higher).
Since August 25, 2014 (O.G. Nº 40 482, Decree No. 1.192), the issuance, modification, granting and revocation of import licenses, Certificates of National Non-Production (CNP) and Certificates of Production Insufficiency (CIP), will be centralised by CENCOEX), and its authorisation can only be made with the approval of the Executive Vice President. The mechanisms and procedures concerning the processing of licenses and certificates will be established by CENCOEX, through internal norms. In addition, the Executive Vice President, by means of a Resolution, with the previous opinion of CENCOEX, may exempt the presentation CNP or CIP, when it is evident that the item has no production in the country or it is insufficient.
From September 2018, in accordance with Decrees 3547 and 3600 dated on 25/07/2018 and 31/08/2018 (O.G. 41,456 and 41,472), the presentation of the National Non-Production Certificate and the Insufficient Production Certificate is waived, as well as the payment of Import Tax, Customs Tax and VAT were exonerated until December 31, 2019 to the final imports of goods identified in Annexes I and II of the Joint Resolution of (O.G. 6.402 (E) dated 31/08/2018) of the Ministries of Industry and National Production DM/N°020, of Economy and Finance DM/N°077, for Productive Agriculture and Lands DM/N° 069, for Fisheries and Aquaculture DM/N° 031, for Food DM/N°044, for Health DM/N°199, for DM Oil/No. 107, for Foreign Trade and International Investment DM-No.033.

11413	False	Active	Venezuela	"On 29 December 2017, a new Constitutional Law on Foreign Productive Investment entered into force (O.G. No. 41310), approved by the National Constituent Assembly (NCA), which revokes the Foreign Investment Law of 18 November 2014 (O.G (E) 6.152).
The Law incorporates regulations that restrict the movement of foreign direct investment (FDI) to the Venezuelan economy. It concedes huge discretionary powers to the President of the Republic to adopt measures that modify the mandates established in the Law, without the opinion of other public entities, regulators or arbitrators.
The Law transfers the rules exercised by the National Centre for Foreign Trade (CENCOEX) to the Ministry for Foreign Trade and International Investment (MIPPCOEXIN), and expands the surveillance functions over companies that invest with foreign capital, and for the establishment of FDI policies.
The minimum investment is EUR 800 000, or RMB 6.5 million or its equivalent in another currency with a term of not less than two years. The repatriation of capital and profits is allowed 2 years after the investment was made. It is allowed to repatriate up to 100% of the profits obtained in a year and the total of the investment in case of liquidation of the company, once discounted the applicable taxes. The President may reduce these percentages of repatriation between 60% and 80% in special economic situations.
The Law includes an investment contract, which must be signed by the foreign investor with its local public or private counterpart, including all the terms and conditions of the investment. This contract is part of the documents required for the Foreign Investment Registry that must be made before the MIPPCOEXIN, regardless of the activity to which the investment is dedicated.
In contrast to the 2014 law it is not possible to keep part of the investment or assets abroad, since it is required that 100 % the constituent value of the investment must be represented by assets present within the country. The assets invested will also be subject to surveillance from the MIPPCOEXIN. In addition, it establishes the channelling of all monetary funds obtained from FDI through the national financial system. Consequently, the use of accounts abroad for the management of the investment is restricted, having to use only the national banks for this purpose. Likewise, the Law establishes a 15% limit on the maximum amount of domestic financing.
Investors with income of more than 70% from oil exports, or mining, must pay their taxes in foreign currency. Investors are allowed to carry out financial transactions, if they do not imply new capital investments. Any financial action must be notified to MIPPCOEXIN, otherwise it would be considered void.
The Venezuelan State reserves for itself the development of strategic sectors according to the national interest. These sectors are not explicitly defined by law, which leaves a legal vacuum with respect to access and treatment criteria. In addition, for reasons of security and defence, the Government might decree especial investment regimes with the participation of foreign capital at different access levels than those established by law.
The Law orders exhausting the national judicial means (courts) for the solution of controversies before resorting to any other mechanism offered by the integration systems of Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as within the framework of other integration schemes.
The system of fines in case of breach of the investor obligations increases. The pecuniary sanctions are calculated based on a percentage of the total amount invested, payable in the currency in which the investment was made within a period of 15 days. The MIPPCOEXIN may also consider the suspension of favourable conditions granted to the investment, such as accelerated depreciation, purchase of production by public entities, tariff and tax exemptions, special rates for public services, preferential access to inputs or raw materials administered by the State, and any other benefit provided by the Government. The registration of foreign investment might also be revoked.
The Law prohibits the investor from participating in political activities or boycotts that could be considered as destabilizing and/or that threaten democracy and institutions, as well as in shaping opinions on topics of public interest in social media. MIPPCOEXIN will authorise the participation in social activities within the country or to collaborate in any way with any Venezuelan institution, whether public or private."

10212	False	Active	Israel	"In December 1994, the Knesset passed the Kosher Meat Import Law, which requires that all meat, poultry and their products imported into Israel be accompanied by a certificate of Kashrut issued by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel or any other body authorised by it to do so. Therefore, Israel prohibits imports of non-kosher meat (with a limited exception of for some non-kosher meat products of around 1,200 tons annually), while it allows the domestic production and marketing of non-kosher meat. As regards imports of other kosher products, such as cheese and dairy products, the Rabbinical supervision in the exporting countries is not sufficient (after obtaining in advance the authorisation of the Israeli Chief Rabbinate).
In late 2015 fresh meat was exported from Poland for the first time. The EU have repeatedly asked the Israeli authorities to allow for recognition of kosher slaughtering done by Rabbis in Europe to reduce or eliminate  the cost of the Chief Rabbinate's supervision on the ground in the EU MS concerned. Due to the high political sensitivity of the issue for the time being the Israeli Government is reluctant to push for rapid changes. Instead the Government opted for an incremental approach to increase imports of fresh meat from the EU through among others initiating meetings with the EU side to explain the requirements to import to the country and also through streamlining the veterinary certification. The aim is that this process will gradually create the conditions to ease the quasi monopoly position of the Chief Rabbinate in recognizing kosher slaughtering. This would also serve the Israeli Government's ultimate objective to reduce the cost of living in the country. The EU should keep up the pressure The EU should keep up the pressure, possibly including the multilateral context. As it appears – and it was acknowledge by the IL authorities during the last Trade Policy Review process in the WTO of July 2018 -  that there are certain exceptions to this monopoly of the Chief Rabbinate.  For instance rabbis in the US may be authorized to issue such kosher certificates for exportation of meat to Israel.

The new Turkish system does not follow the EU CPNP (EU Cosmetics Products Notification Portal) and asks many more bits of information than the CPNP.

10112	False	Active	Turkey	As of October 3rd 2014, the Turkish customs communiqué 90 was amended. This communiqué identifies the customs directorates authorized to carry out formalities governing release of furniture for free circulation in Turkey. The amended part of the commuiniqué 90 designates and differentiates the customs offices authorized to clear furniture with EU and non-EU origin. The impossibility for non-EU origin furniture to be cleared by the customs administration from where the goods enter the country will imply increase of the transport costs (because of the additional distance), increase in terms of traffic and negative environmental effects. To designate specific customs offices for declaring specific goods as such is not against customs rules and it happens also in the EU MS. However, this practice has to be justified (special type of goods, special expertise required for clearance etc). In addition to this justification, there can not be a discrimination between the goods of EU and non-EU origine.

12561	False	Active	Mozambique	"Mozambique notified its new control seal regime to the WTO via TBT Notification G/TBT/N/MOZ/10 (Notification issued on 7th December 2016). This notification mentions Decree 69/2009, which states that a control seal regime is about to be developed. The notification omits to mention Decree 59/2016, which lays out the rules and practicalities surrounding the new control stamp regime.
 The industry has two major concerns regarding the new regime: 

The proposed date of implementation of the new control seal regime is retrospective (14th September 2016), and is the same as the date of publication of the rules surrounding the control stamp regime in Decree 59/2016. It seems the measure was already in force at the time of the WTO Notification.
The control stamp regime in Decree 59/2016 does not comply with WTO law. It discriminates overtly through different prices charged for control stamps to imported and domestic producers of ‘like’ beverage categories. The price differences applied in Euros, per 1000 stamps, are as follows:





Alcoholic beverages


Spirit drinks


Beer


Wine




Domestic


15.30


6.85


12.25




Imported


29.68


9.57


27.07





A final concern exists with the lack of flexibility in the application of the control seal. Decree 59/2016 only permits the application of control stamps ‘before importation’. This restriction on company practices is unnecessary, and Mozambique should also permit the application of the control seals in bonded warehouses in Mozambique, at no extra cost to itself.

Although Chapter 24 covers ten tariff lines, of particular concern to the industry (British American Tobacco) is the specific tariff line concerning cigarettes containing tobacco (HS 2402 20). The GCC decision appears to be conditional upon its consistency with the obligations of single GCC members under the WTO.
On 10 March 2016, Saudi Arabia was the first GCC member to implement the abovementioned amendment. Its WTO schedule binds cigarettes to a 200% ad valorem duty or a minimum specific rate of SR200/1,000 cigarettes, whichever is higher. In practice, it used to apply a 100% ad valorem duty with a minimum specific charge of SR100/1,000 cigarettes. Following the GCC amendment, Saudi Arabia applies a 100% ad valorem with a minimum specific charge of SR200/1,000 cigarettes. This does not appear to have given rise to any WTO compatibility concerns.  Oman followed suit and recently doubled the minimum specific component of its external tariff for tobacco products. Oman's WTO schedule binds cigarettes to a 150% ad valorem duty. In practice, the country used to apply a 100% ad valorem duty with a minimum specific charge of OMR10/1,000 cigarettes. Following the GCC amendment, Oman is now applying a 100% ad valorem duty with a minimum specific charge of OMR20/1,000 cigarettes.

However, an economic needs test (ENT) is compulsory for any retail outlet to be established beyond the first one.

11185	False	Active	United States of America	"The Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 ('FINSA') amends the so-called Exon-Florio amendment of the Defense Production Act of 1950, which authorises the US President to investigate foreign acquisitions, mergers, and takeovers of, or investments in, US companies from a national security perspective. In 2008, final regulations that implement FINSA were published. These regulations complete the reform of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ('CFIUS'), an inter-agency committee chaired by the US Treasury to which the US President's review and decision-making authorities provided by the Exon-Florio amendment have been delegated.
The US President and CFIUS have blocked only 2 investments so far (in the 1990s and one in 2012). However, this figure conceals some worrying practices and trends. First of all, there are a growing number of investors, who, after having filed to CFIUS, renounce their envisaged investment in the US and withdraw their filing. Investors are said to be uncertain about CFIUS review and fear negative decisions which could seriously impact on the image of the company.
While statutory timetables have not changed, caution within CFIUS has resulted in longer review times. CFIUS has also increased the number of mitigation agreements as a condition for approval and new, unprecedented terms for CFIUS approval have also emerged, i.e. evergreen provisions, which give the US Administration the capacity to re-open the terms of the agreement and even undo the investment under certain circumstances. This practice is a departure from the 'safe harbour' against a future divestment order that CFIUS approval was understood to provide.
The performance of CFIUS and the Committee's manner of reviewing cases involving foreign governments has been questioned by some Members of Congress and others, in particular as regards the emergence of direct investments through sovereign wealth funds (SWFs).

11410	False	Active	Paraguay	"Access to public procurement for foreign bidders is restricted to specific cases and conditions. International public competitive bidding in Paraguay is used as an exception to national bidding only in specific circumstances and, in the event of equivalent offers, preference is given to the offers which incorporate certain levels of local content. In addition when assessing the economic value of different bids, contracting entities may grant a certain margin of preference of up to 10%. In 2010 Paraguay introduced with decree 4008/2010 price preferences for goods and services of Paraguayan origin for a period of one year. Decree 6225/2011 and law 4558/2011 replaced decree 4008/2010 and continue with similar margins of preference for local content. These preferences from 5% up to 70% and have the aim of increasing national production and local employment.
 
Background
According to Paraguayan legislation (Ley 2051/2003 de Contrataciones Públicas), access to public procurement for foreign bidders (not domiciled in Paraguay) is restricted to the following cases: obligation under an international treaty, agreements with international organisations (such as a loan agreement with a multilateral institution), insufficient local supply of goods and services of the quality required or price of such goods or services is not suitable, and in the case that no proposal was submitted in a national tendering procedure (Article 18 of Ley 2051 of 2003 ). Moreover, companies from countries with no reciprocal treatment for Paraguayan firms can be excluded from bidding.
International public competitive bidding in Paraguay is used as an exception to national bidding only in specific circumstances and, in the event of equivalent offers, preference is given to the offers which incorporate more that 50% of local content. In addition when assessing the economic value of different bids, contracting entities may grant a margin of preference of up to 10% (Article 18 of Ley 2051/2003).
On 26 February 2010 Paraguay introduced with decree 4008/2010 national price preferences in public tenders for a period of one year, which was replaced by decree 6225/2011 and law 4558/2011 (see below). Paraguay has introduced these temporary preferences in order to increase national production and local employment to overcome the international economic crisis. The margin of preferences shall be determined by the contracting entities and range between 5% and 70% for manufactured goods and between 20% to 70% for primary products of agricultural origin. For construction services, the contracting entity can require the contractors to have at least 70% of the personnel locally recruited.
On 4 March 2011 Paraguay published decree 6225/2011 which replaced decree 4008/2010 regarding public works and infrastructure. The margin of preferences may range between 5% and 70%, for manufactured products 40%, for primary products of agricultural origin between 20% and 70%, for construction services at least 70% of the personnel must be locally recruited, and for services 10%.
On 15 December 2011 Paraguay published Law (Ley) 4558/2011 regarding good and services, which foresees in national tenders a margin of preferences of 20% for local products and services. National products are defined as being from Paraguayan origin or with an imported part of up to 40%, while national construction services require at least 70% of the locally recruited personnel. Decree 9649/2012 of 7 September 2012 provides details on regarding the determination of national origin concerning the Law 4558/2011."

11187	False	Active	United States of America	The US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which was enacted in March 2010, and is due to become operative from 1 July this year, is designed to increase the ability of the US tax authorities to combat cross-border tax evasion by US persons who use foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to hide assets and avoid reporting income taxable in the US. FATCA tries to achieve this objective by imposing obligations on the FFIs to carry out due-diligence, reporting and withholding tasks on behalf of the US tax authorities. FFIs are defined to include not just banks but also funds, insurance companies, securitisation vehicles and many other entities. While FATCA’s aim is a legitimate one which the EU and many other countries support, it has caused serious concern to financial intermediaries because of the legal problems and administrative burdens that it will create.In recognition of the many legal difficulties that foreign financial institutions may face in reporting directly to the US under FATCA, the US is currently concluding FATCA agreements with other countries under which the financial institutions will report to the tax authorities of their own countries instead of directly to the US and will not be required to withhold US tax (except in few specific cases).The tax authorities of those countries will then report the information to the US tax authorities.While these FATCA agreements may eliminate all or most of the legal difficulties for financial institutions, potentially they will not remove all the difficulties for EU financial institutions to invest in the US market or market their products to US clients since i.a. to do so will now carry reporting obligations.Furthermore, FATCA does not impose on US financial institutions the same obligations that it imposes on FFIs. They do not have the same level of due diligence, reporting and withholding obligations in relation to US citizens and they are not required to report on anything other than interest payments and US source dividends paid to non-US citizens.
