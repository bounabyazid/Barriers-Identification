These new decrees impose an ECAS requiring certain products to have an Emirates Quality Mark (EQM) certificate of conformity subjected to verification of UAE. This label is already in use mainly for industrial products, but UAE has now expanded this to dairy and juices. For the dairy products the scope is currently linked to eight dairy products including yoghurt. Also some beverages such as fruit juice products will be affected.
These decrees will prove burdensome for EU exporters as many aspects of the decrees remain unclear and will create uncertainties as the decrees do not outline clearly what will be required of suppliers who wish to adhere to this ECAS. The main concern for the EU is that EU establishments exporting these products would need to be sending documentation to the notification bodies (to one of the three notification bodies all situated in the UAE). In addition, UAE requires to perform on-site inspections with at the same time incurring costly registration fees. This would mean an important additional burden and huge cost for the EU exporters while the EU already has a solid food safety inspection system in place.

In the Andean Community Resolution 1587 (which entered into force in May 2013), banned imports on Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) of several products such as: live bovine animals, bovine products and by-products. Concentrated meat containing meat/blood/bone meal, bovine meat, bone meal and mammalian offal meal or food additives that contain ruminant proteins for feed animal use from the countries concerned and with different status of negligible risk, are also banned.
However, this regulation excludes some products such as: milk and dairy products, semen and bovine embryos, sebum without protein, di-calcium phosphate, hides and skins, gelatine and collagen. Also, veterinary products not elaborated with risk products identified in Terrestrial Animal Health Code, as long as these products come from animals of negligible risk, as well the feed for felines and canines which comply with the same requirements, are allowed. Deboned bovine meat of animal less 30 months of age is allowed complying with several conditions.
In addition, for de-bone fresh meat and meat products from cattle, the OIE code states that not import conditions should be set regardless of the BSE status of the exporting country and therefore it can be exported from BSE affected countries following compliance with certain certifications requirements. In the case of other bovine products, the OIE code states that Veterinary Administrations should authorise without restriction the imports of: milk and milk products, semen, embryos, hides, skins, gelatine and collagen.
This measure is against the Terrestrial Animal Health Code.

Denmark, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy,  Luxemburg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, United Kingdom, Sweden.

11860	False	Active	Canada	"Several EU Member States are interested to export seed potatoes to Canada. An application is pending since 2012.  Canada, the United States and Mexico have been working to align the North American regional standard on the movement of potatoes into a NAPPO member country (RSPM 3) with the IPPC standard ISPM 33.  This process is still ongoing.
Traditionally, the import of field grown seed potatoes, in vitro plantlets, microtubers, minitubers and cuttings and other potato propagative materials from markets other than the United States are imported into Canada through post entry quarantine (PEQ).  Statistics show that this import procedure from Canada is not feasible for European exports of seed potatoes as it is considered unnecessarily trade restrictive. The details of access are contained in CFIA policy D-98-01 (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/plants/plant-pests-invasive-species/directives/potatoes/d-98-01/eng/1312247584545/1312247683833).      
The relevant international standard ISPM 33 (IPPC) provides the option of an alternative means to trade micropropagative materials and minitubers.  The new draft of NAPPO RSPM 3 will refer to this process as post entry monitoring (PEM) and will rely on an integrated systems approach to ensure the production of pest free potato micropropagative materials and minitubers.  PEM would reduce the timelines for obtaining the potato germplasm for propagation.  Post entry quarantine will continue. 
At present discussions continue in Canada to align its policy with ISPM 33 and at the same time the final requirements will also need to be consistent with the final version of RSPM 3 (NAPPO).
Despite several requests from the EU, Canada has not been able to provide an indicative timeline on when these alignment procedures towards ISPM 33 (IPPC) will be finalised and thus imports into Canda of seed potatoes from interested EU Member States following the ISPM 33 approach remains blocked.  
According to the EU, a swift treatment of this application should be feasible, given the negligible risk of the good.
The EU continues to raise this issue with Canada at different fora and expects that the pending application process for the imports of seed potatoes into Canada from the EU could be finalised without any further delay.

Detailed information on the control measures (regionalisation) implemented in the EU is shared with trading partners immediately when outbreaks occur. Therefore, the EU considers that a country-wide ban is not in line with international rules (WTO SPS Agreement and OIE international standards) as it is considered more trade restrictive than necessary.
However, the EU welcomes that the Competent Authorities of the United Arab Emirates recognise the regionalisation policy of the EU for HPAI with allowing imports of most poultry products (such as meat) to continue as the United Arab Emirates limit its trade restrictions to those areas affected with HPAI and which are put under control by the competent authority of the exporting country.
The international standard of the OIE clearly states that a free status of the country, zone, compartment, can be regained three months after a stamping-out policy has applied. The EU policy applies a strict stamping-out policy in accordance with international rules of the OIE and informs the OIE and trading partners accordingly.

Other countries still might export through other ports in ID, but this leads to much more complicated trade flows.
 The closure of Tanjung Priok Port is linked to the CRA, meaning that the imported products can enter Tanjung Priok Port as long as they are exported from countries having a CRA with ID. As of today there are 9 countries have concluded CRA with ID: Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa and United States. Consequently imports from those countries have access (but only for the specific products mentioned/listed in the CRA) to the main port of Tanjung Priok, Jakarta.  From the Member States, only France was granted the FFPO CRA in 2017, which concerns 20 products of plant origin intended for human consumption. In 2019, France extended its CRA with a validity period of three years, until 2022.   In practical terms, EU exports of fruits and vegetables are much hindered by this measure. Minister of Agriculture Regulation No 4/2015 was key in setting up this very complex system. It has been replaced by Regulation 55/2016, which remains the latest development in the field of imports of food of plant origin. The regulation covers basically fresh food of plant origin. (FPPO).  In case of FFPO, the system requires either a Country Recognition Agreement (CRA) or an alternative system based on registration-approval of laboratories (ReLab) involved in the export chain, with systematic testing of every consignment. As an additional difference, countries with CRA (or at least recognition of pest free areas) could access Jakarta Tanjung Priok port, while this would not be possible for countries approved via ReLab system. While obtaining a CRA would require systematically an audit, it is possible that recognition of the laboratory system does not seem toneed a mandatory audit. This still needs to be clarified with Indonesia. The Regulation 55/2016 introduced a third option, not explored yet, for exports without laboratory registration, but with more stringent consignment tests and import checks. The regulation stipulates that countries with no FFPO CRA and registered labs may use prior notice and Certificate of Food Safety, i.e. a written guarantee issued by the authorised food safety control system agency from the exporting country stating that the FFPO is safe and can be consumed.  While some Member States, i.e. Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Romania and Spain, have obtained registration of some laboratories, access to Tanjung Priok port is still an unresolved issue for the EU exports."

Lengthy procedures: Procedures require an average registration time of 6-9 months, while the legal requirement for BPOM is 45 days. However, recent reports show a considerable improvement in registration procedures, albeit still being burdensome.
Onerous requirements: each ingredient needs be declared together with an analysis report, a requirement of a process chart of manufacturing process, which is also an IPR issue, since information requested may require the revelation of proprietary trade secrets.

Recent Regulation 42/2019states that a country of origin for the importation of carcass, meat, edible offal and processed meat of large ruminant must be free from Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), as referred to in Article 8. In alignment with international standards of the OIE on BSE, the Regulation opens for import from negligible status countries and seems to possibly open a door from imports from controlled status countries for imports of large ruminant meat, in the form of boneless/deboned meat, with the exception of Mechanically Separated Meat (MSM) and Mechanically Deboned Meat (MDM), or bone-in meat. In any case, imports are very limited. Indonesian legislation requires both country and establishment approval (through both a declaration (questionnaire), import risk evaluation and on-site assessment) for import of meat and meat products.
This process is burdensome and non-transparent. The criteria for passing the approval process are unclear, thus resulting in a long approval procedure. Related to others diseases, Indonesia require absence of a number of diseases in a country or establishment for which OIE does not consider trade measures necessary.
Trading conditions (not SPS) set in Regulation 42/2019 make even more complicated market access: restrictions on certain cuts and products, , an unclear and complex import license system, including the two-layer requirement to import, i.e. import recommendation from the Agriculture Minister and import permit from the Trade Minister. Also Halal matters are a significant complication. New policies are planned without consulting trading partners, potentially completely banning or severely obstructing imports.
Since the introduction of the ban in 2001 the EU together with trading partners have consistently raised the issue in all available fora, and in bilateral meetings. Update: the regulation 58/2015 apparently might allow imports of countries with controlled risk status, though the wording make this unclear. The EU is still trying to get clarification on this. As mentioned, a number of non-strictly SPS barriers are still present in this regulation.

Article 34 mandates that ""staple foods"" can only be exported if domestic consumption is fulfilled and national food reserves are sufficient. Food can only be exported after considering domestic food consumption and national interests. Article 36 mandates that food can only be imported if domestic production is insufficient or the item cannot be produced domestically. Articles 46/51/55/56/108- Allows and notes a government ""obligation"" to stabilize the supply and price of ""staple foods"". This can be done, among other ways, by price fixing, provision and management of food supply and food trading, establishment of tax/tariff policy in favour of national interests, and regulation of import and export. Article 55 protects income and buying power of Indonesian farmers and fishermen, whereas article 56 allows establishing tax and tariffs in favour of national interests.
Burdensome registration and labelling requirements and import conditions for food products. The enforcement of food safety through food sanitation; control of food additives, genetically engineered food products and food irradiation; establishment of food packaging standard; issuing food quality and safety guarantee; and halal product guarantee for those required. Labelling requirements through putting the label inside and/or outside of the food package contains the product’s name, list of used ingredients, net weight, date and production code, and halal (for those required).
Unjustified import restrictions on a number of animals and animal products. Since 2001, Indonesia started applying an import ban on animals and a range of animal products where it considered there was a risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). While there is a certain progression towards international standards in Regulation 42/2019 there are still divergences. The previous pattern of BSE monitoring, however, continues with apparently allowed imports from countries with controlled risk status but unclear procedures and requirements (see also fiche no. 10580). Indonesia requires absence of a number of diseases in a country or establishment for which OIE does not consider trade measures necessary. Indonesia introduced the principle of regionalisation in its legislation from 2009 only for Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and not for other diseases for which OIE also foresees this principle. As an example, Indonesia requires country freedom for African Swine Fever. Regulation 23/2018 amended some parts of the previous regulation 34/2016, adding a requirement for the halal certification of the products.
Law 18/2009 introduced burdensome and non-transparent risk assessment procedures for meat and dairy imports stemming from country establishment approval requirements. The regulation 58/2015, and later 6/2015, contain annexes with conditions for import of certain products of animal origin. For those products not mentioned in the Annex, the EU is seeking information on the import conditions. There is a lack of transparency and undue delay for the approval processes , thus resulting in a long and burdensome approval procedures not in line with the WTO SPS agreement (see also fiche no.14882). This is further compounded by the fact that Indonesia claims to lack resources for carrying out the audits. Law 18/2009 introduced a country and establishment approval entailing that every single exporting establishment need to be inspected. The procedure requires that foreign companies exporting fresh animal products (meat, dairy products, eggs etc.) have to register which are then to be submitted to plant-by-plant inspections. This system is repeated in in Regulation 34/2016 on imports of meat and carcass. This is further compounded by the fact that Indonesia claims to lack resources for carrying out audits.
Since 2016, Indonesia has been imposing very expensive fees for processing a market access application, through Government Regulation/ Peraturan Pemerintah (PP) no. 35/2016 including. There are fees for all import applications, including a fee for the desk evaluation, a fees for audits and a fee for the after visit report and evaluation (see also fiche no. 13542)."

Moreover, the new import conditions have not been notified to WTO. As a result, imports from the EU are unnecessarily hampered and in practice, these measures block imports of milk and white cheeses from the EU (and other trading partners) due to imposing unrealistic limitations for e.g. the shelf life for milk and white cheeses. These new measures are considered discriminatory as they clearly favour the domestic production by e.g. reducing drastically the shelf life requirement for imported milk/white cheeses.

EU Member States exporting without pre-listing, have been given the possibility (until the end of 2017) to add establishments to their existing lists of approved establishments and without having to be audited by MAPA beforehand. MAPA may perform audits at a later stage. According to MAPA, there will be over 1000 establishments approved by EU Member States to export products of animal origin to Brazil. These will add to the over 2300 establishments already approved to export products of animal origin from the EU to Brazil. 
The existing pre-listing, which had been granted to certain Member States for certain products, will continue, separetely.
The European Commission will continue pushing MAPA to transform this one-off opportunity into a process permanent, and to speed up all the pending market access applications.
To ensure that all those new establishments can effectively export to Brazil, EU Member States will have to use bilateral or harmonized certificates (the latter are under negotiation) and send to MAPA their ""authentication elements"" (e.g. official stamps).
The undue delays and the lack of a swift pre-listing provided by Brazil to all EU Member States results in serious impact on trade, since EU Member States wishing to add a new establishment for exports into Brazil should wait first for a mission to be carried out on-the-spot by the Brazilian competent authorities. This resulted in severe undue delays, cumbersome and unpredictable administrative procedures and in unnecessary costs. 
The European Commission had called Brazil to improve the level of predictability, to perform more visits to EU Member States and to shorten the delays between the visits and opening of markets are expected from MAPA.

This has been a long-standing trade irritant as EU exporters have not been able to export certain processed food to Japan or would need to modify the recipes accordingly.
 Japanese list of accepted food additives is not fully in line with the applicable international standards set up at the CODEX Alimentarius. Japan still does not accept some additives recognized as safe by food safety evaluation bodies such as the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the EC Scientific Committee on Food or the European Food Safety Authority. In 2002, the EU and Japan agreed on a list of 46 priority food additives that the Japanese would approve in an accelerated pace. The priority list has in practice been finalised in 2015 except food additives containing aluminium. The finalisation of the first priority list could have been seen as a first step towards the harmonisation of the Japanese legislation on food additives with international standards, in accordance with the provisions of the WTO SPS Agreement. However, beyond the first priority list there are still other food additives not yet approved by Japan.
Since several new food additives are approved every year in the EU, the procedural aspect is of critical importance for the future. In terms of transparency, the Japanese authorities have issued, published and translated into English the majority of the relevant guidelines related to the approval process:

Guidelines for the Designation of Flavoring Agents (30 November 2016)[1]
Guidelines for the Designation of Food Additives and Revision of Standards for Use of Food Additives (30 November 2016)[2]
Guidelines for the Assessment of Flavoring Substances in Foods on Health (22 December 2016)[3]
Guideline for Assessment of the Effect of Food on Human Health Regarding Food Additives[4]
Procedure for Preparing Application Documents for Designation of Food Additives and Revision of Use Standards for Food Additives[5].

The application and overview documents for approval of food additives need to be in Japanese but the reference documents are acceptable in English.
The standard processing time for Japan’s designation process of food additives is now set to be two years; one year for the risk assessment by the Food Safety Commission (FSC) and another year for approval procedure by the Ministry for Health Labour and Welfare. Furthermore, Japan established a consultation centre (Food Additive Designation Consultation Center - FADCC) to assist foreign applicants. As in the EU, the Japanese authorisation system requires a direct application for approval by industry.
The Commission will monitor the proper follow-up by the Japanese authorities, under the EPA mechanism, should such applications eventually be submitted.

Concerning up until December 2017 for Member States detecting cases of African Swine Fever (ASF) in their territory it issued relevant notifications of country-wide import bans to the WTO, specifying that the bans are based on the occurrence of the disease. For those Member States Russia also banned heat-treated products containing pig meat, with the exception of pet food. As regards the other EU Member States, Russia applied a de-facto ban of non-heat treated pig products linked to its refusal to accept the usual adaptations on agreed certificates following the occurrence of a disease, in order to exclude affected areas and allow free areas to continue exports.
The EU made intensive efforts to reach out to Russian authorities. When this proved fruitless, the EU opened a dispute settlement case in WTO in April 2014. The panel's report (August 2016) and the Appellate Body's report (February 2017) were both very favourable to the EU. The EU and Russia agreed on an implementation period by Russia ending on 6 December 2017.
The restriction is compounded by the political embargo imposed by Russia in August 2014, initially for one year but repeatedly extended and currently valid until the end of 2019. From the products affected by the ASF-ban, the political embargo initially covered pig meat but did not affect pig fat, offal and live pigs. This would mean when Russia modified its SPS measures to comply with the WTO ruling   as it (partially) did on 5 December 2017 (No. FS-NV-7/26504) export of pig fat and offal as well as of breeding pigs would resume from the areas of the EU it recognised as ASF-free. Out of the 1.4 billion € (2013 statistics) of affected exports by the ASF related sanitary ban about 400 million € (29%) represented pig offal, lard and fat. However, on 25 October 2017, Russia extended the scope of the political embargo by decree 1292 to animal offal and fat as well as to live pigs (except for breeding).
 WTO consultations on Russia's compliance were held in Geneva on 28 February 2018. As no solution was found, the EU requested a compliance panel in October 2018 to assess Russia’s compliance with the recommendations and rulings of the Appellate Body and the panel in 2017. The panel was composed in December 2018 and is expected to issue its final report in early 2020.

12301	False	Active	South Africa	"SA authorities take several years to evaluate questionnaires used in the negotiations of import permits and health certificates by new applicants (such as in the case of a number of EU MS). For pork and other meats, SA operates a queue system with no indication of duration for the handling of the application. SA authorities affirm that delays are due to lack of resources and that no applicant is treated more favourably than others.
With regards to pork, the process has been particular slow and restrictive due to SA rules on PRRS control. PL questionnaires have been validated in 2016, while discussions commenced in 2004. The final report is being completed and draft health certificates are being finalised. The queue currently comprises AT, SE and FI. AT has been waiting for more than four years. In the case of SE and FI (which are PRRS free according to OIE), SA has explained that declaration of freedom may have a positive impact only when the assessment starts but would not warrant fast-tracking because Sweden and Finland, being part of the EU market, are exposed to free circulation from other EU MS.
Regarding poultry, Lithuania has applied for import of poultry and poultry products in 2012 and still waiting.
Regarding beef, contrary to reassurances by SA, new health certificates are not yet available to Member States whose BSE status under OIE has improved and despite the fact that SA's cabinet has authorised DAFF to issue them. DAFF indicated further information might be required on use of animal protein and slaughterhouses. Application for IT Bresaola has been pending for a long time – IT has been number 8 on the list for 3 years now. The SA authorities consider Bresaola to be fresh meat – resulting from a dispute on the temperatures for treatment. DAFF requires 70 degrees, which also poses issues with mortadella.
SA also insists that the EU needs to explain how BSE and other EU SPS controls are addressed in intra-community trade. SA requires information on how EU MS with different risk profiles manage imports among them and monitor exports to third countries which may ensue. As long as such explanation is provided, BSE status of all EU countries will be kept at levels which may be higher than the ones claimed individually under OIE and a declaration of freedom would have limited, if any impact. The SA authorities (DAFF) had told France that a mission to the EU would be sent to look into the issue.
With regards to poultry, DAFF is refusing to resume imports from the NL after declaration of freedom from HPAI, contrary to past practice. In a letter to industry, reference is made to the ""plight of the (local poultry) industry"" (which has already led to the imposition of antidumping and provisional safeguard duties). It would thus appear that SPS issues are going to be used as trade defence measures. DAFF has announced intention to go to a fact finding mission to EU MS to verify freedom.

10686	False	Active	Malaysia	"The current inspection fee based system for foreign establishments seeking approval to export to Malaysia dates from 2010 and raises several concerns: 
1) Inspections depend upon the availability of inspectors from two different Malaysian administrations (JAKIM for halal matters regarding all meats except for pork and DVS for veterinary matters concerning all meats) which can cause delays; 
2) There is a lack of detailed information about the requirements and standards applied by the inspectors creating a lack of consistency and predictability regarding inspections outcomes; 
3) The validity of JAKIM approvals is limited (only 1 year with a possible extension up to 2 more years based on annual reports by the competent authority of the exporting country); 
4) In relation to ""Halal requirements"", Malaysia does not recognise export certificates issued by any foreign Islamic Organisation, hence the export of any halal meat product requires an initial inspection by JAKIM of the exporting establishments in order to be certified. The keeping of such certification can be made by halal certifying bodies in the exporting country duly recognised by JAKIM.
