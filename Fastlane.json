Wine and longevity! Just what the wine drinking public wants to hear!!\n\nSardinia is a beautiful island. With a rich history. You have so much geological and historical material with which to tell wonderful stories. And to produce heart-stopping picturesque videos.\n\nFood. Wine. Art. A trifecta of interesting topics to write. And talk about. \n\nGo for it.\n\nHire someone who will translate your stories into good English. And post as blog posts. And distribute to social media platforms. As well as journalists. And other people in your industry.\n\nGet your beautiful videos of Sardinia up on YouTube. And do the same with them.\n\nFind people who do podcasts about wine and travel. And see if they will interview you.\n\nThese are three areas you can start to develop right now.\n\nThe rest you will learn as you go.\n\nThis is a multi-year journey, Delia. And you will be amazed at where it takes you. If you're consistent. And disciplined about doing something every day to get you from A to B.\n\nI will now have to put Sardinia on my bucket list. Thank you for the invitation.\n\nIf you're ever in Oz. And want to experience some quiet time away from the hub-bub of a busy life, we have a guest house on our rural property you will love. Meadow House Getaway.  Meadow House Getaway | Relax. Renew. Recover.\n\nI have a page on my website for my Travel Bug Shoe Bag that features places to visit. If you have a website, I would love to do a small post about Sardinia.

You will meet fabulous people here. And become friends with many of them.\n\nIt's also my pleasure to meet you, Dave. And thank you for your very kind words.\n\n\n\nHugh Nivers said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nSo on to my question: In your experience, have you met many entrepreneurs who are now successful, but who just couldn't get themselves and their path figured out until later in life?Click to expand...\n\nI'm a later in life example of someone who has done just that.\n\nNot voluntarily. But certainly, my partner and I started this business at an age when most people wouldn't be thinking of reinventing themselves.\n\nWhen we started in 1994, the word entrepreneur wasn't a description used to describe a person starting a small business. The word was reserved for a higher echelon of business types. Elon Musk comes to mind. Richard Branson.\n\nToday, anyone who isn't working in a corporate environment is an entrepreneur.\n\nThe answer to your question is YES! There are many people who didn't get it together until later in life. Who are running very successful businesses.\n\nEveryone has baggage. Including teenagers. And some people never get it together. And drift from A to B to C.\n\nEvidence is that the older you are when you start a business, the better your odds are of lasting the distance.\n\nYou're not as impatient. You already know that 'Business Is A Tough Gig'. You're more committed to the end result. You have wisdom. And a greater experience of life.\n\nAll that being said, there are three words that apply to everybody who starts a business.\n\nCommitment. You must be committed to seeing it through. Regardless of how crushing it can be at times. And it can be extremely crushing. And disappointing. There are so many times when you run into a headwind. The sails fall off the mast. The boat is taking on water. And the temptation to quit and throw in the towel is just too easy to do.\n\nOne of LinkedIn's most successful Virtual Assistant recently did a post about why she's so successful. And it's simple. She said she gave herself no option to call it quits. It had to work. There was no escape hatch.\n\nDiscipline. Dan Kennedy said it best. \"Self discipline is the magic power that makes you virtually unstoppable.\"\n\nThat means you do things even if you don't feel like doing them. Or aren't motivated to do them. Or you just prefer to procrastinate.\n\nAs with everything in life. We are all where we are today because of how much. Or how little. We do.\n\nConsistency. Do something every day to get you from A to B.\n\nI'm a lover of Microsoft's OneNote. My whole business and personal life is in that notebook.\n\nMy plans. My ideas. My goals. My ambition. My To Do's.\n\nI keep it open on my desktop all the time so I can key in thoughts as they come into my head during the day.\n\nI use that information to, on Sunday afternoon, make a weekly list of everything I need to do. I break it down into daily activities.\n\nSocial media.\n\nBlog posts.\n\nWebsite.\n\nTarget markets.\n\nOnline orders.\n\nI have developed the habit of doing these things on a consistent basis. Not when I feel like doing it. But consistently. Every day.\n\nI wouldn't be where I am today if I did things only when I felt like it.\n\nExamples of late in life successful entrepreneurs.\n\nThese three are from Australia.\n\nA lawyer who is 76. Who couldn't bear another day of conflict in divorce cases.\n\nShe quit her law firm when she was 70. And started her own law firm. Handling only those divorces cases that are amicable. With no conflict regarding property. Or children. Her clients love this approach. Appreciate her fixed fee. And word of mouth is making her very successful.\n\nA gentleman who is 79 started a business at age 72 placing older men and women in employment.\n\nHe's even providing older workers to Australian banks. In their customer service area. The banks have discovered that these people have wisdom and experience of life that enables them to empathise with customers better. And their level of customer complaints has dropped.\n\nHe's now expanding into placing men and women who have a disability into gainful employment.\n\nA prominent woman in the wellness industry started her business at age 67. And hasn't looked back. She also has 4 employees. None of which are under the age of 65.\n\nI'm sure none of these men and women found it easy. But they gave themselves no option but to make their businesses work.\n\nYou can be anything you want to be, Dave. So long as you're committed to doing the hard yards to get from A to B. Older age is no barrier to success. But laziness is!\n\nPeople agonise too much today over their purpose in life. And their why.\n\nThe self help industry has perpetuated the myth that your 'purpose in life' and your 'why' are important to leading a meaningful life.\n\nNobody asked those questions 25 years ago. Most people just got on with life.\n\nAs we did.\n\nWe crashed. We got up. Looked around for something else to do. And did it.\n\nWe weren't paralysed into inaction by deciding we should now discover our 'purpose in life'. And our 'why'.\n\nAnd back then, it never occurred to anyone to 'do what they love'.\n\nBernadette Jiwa, the Australian international best selling business author, included our story in her latest book 'Hunch'. I'm the Ironing Whisperer. On page 73.\n\nWhen she asked me what made us start a business selling ironing board covers, I laughed.\n\nI told her no one in their right mind would choose ironing board covers as the product most likely to be successful.\n\nMy partner, who is an architect, designed this cover for his mother as a gift. To help her with her ironing when she was recovering from a stroke. It was never meant to be a business.\n\nBut it turned into an accidental one.\n\nWhy did we proceed with it?\n\nBecause we were flat broke. No other source of income presented itself. People were throwing money at us to have an ironing board cover that didn't move on their board. We would have been irresponsible not to have run with it. And make something of it.\n\nDid we love it? No. We didn't. We had aspirations to do something more glamourous. More awe inspiring.\n\nBut this business gave Victor the opportunity to design new products.\n\nAnd gave me the opportunity to do something I excel at. Customer service. Letting customers know I love them because they chose me above all other companies. And they responded in kind.\n\nDo I love my business today? Absolutely! I wouldn't trade the last 24 years for anything.\n\nWe dragged the prevailing image of the ironing board cover out of the cheap, trashy, supermarket bin. And elevated ours into a must-have product if you crave quality.\n\nWe created romance around our business by emphasising our remote location in rural Australia. By using photographs of our beautiful rural property on our website. In our email newsletters. And in our printed literature. And by writing about our rural lifestyle in blog posts. We discovered that our lifestyle is now the envy of our customers. And our friends.\n\nAnd by choosing to have our products made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability, we set ourselves apart from everyone else.\n\nIn the beginning, we had no strategy. And none of what we did had anything to do with a 'purpose in life'. Or a 'why'. Or 'do what I love'. It had everything to do with earning $$$$ to put food on the table.\n\nThis business is now part of 'my purpose in life'. It's a part of 'why' I love my life. And it allows me to 'do what I love to do'. Which is to give back to other people.\n\nI hope this helps you. And inspires you! ~Carol\u2764\n\nPS.

This is 24 years ago. Times were different.\n\nThe banks wouldn't lend to us. And wouldn't give us an overdraft. But a friend. Who was an accountant. Told us that the bank would issue a no questions asked credit card for a maximum of $500. Per person.\n\nWe were able to get 2 credit cards with a $500 limit. So we had a slush fund of $1,000 to work with. Which was a fortune to us.\n\nAll our orders were word of mouth. And cash up front. There was no Amazon Prime. Or eBay. That delivered the next day. Everything was mailorder. And people were prepared to wait 30 days to receive their order.\n\nWe would wait until the end of the month to see how many orders we had. And order enough fabric and accessories to fill those orders. So most of what we did came out of cash flow. We had no accounts. So these purchases were cash payments up front for us.\n\nFace to face events and stocking up for them beforehand came out of the credit cards. Which we paid off at the end of every month.\n\nOur marketing consisted of modest events. Which were mainly agricultural shows. And markets. That cost $10. To a maximum of $50. To attend.\n\nWe would leave our farmhouse at 2am to arrive at our destination by 6am. And arrive back at the farmhouse between midnight. And 2am. They were gruelling days.\n\nWe also did letterbox drops. We could do letterbox drops for 3 cents per letter. We produced the leaflets on my computer. And printed them off on our photocopier.\n\nWhen we sold our possessions to pay off debt. We kept some things. My computer. Which was a bulky, boxy, CRT computer with a black screen and green lettering. No graphics. And our photocopier.\n\nVictor, being an architect, was also a very good sketch artist. So our graphics consisted of his pencil sketches of the products.\n\nWe distributed the leaflets to rural areas only. Where rural women were still heavily into ironing. And were used to buying items mailorder. Also, it was rare to see a 'No Junk Mail' sticker on their rural mailboxes.\n\nWe did very well with those leaflets. And were able to build up a strong word of mouth business.\n\nWe led a frugal life.\n\nWe only bought what we needed in the supermarket. No luxuries. No meat. We couldn't afford it. No chocolates.\n\nWe had a vegetable garden. And ate what we could grow.\n\nWe couldn't afford beer. Or wine. Or spirits. Neither of us smoke. We never so much as bought a cup of coffee in a cafe.\n\nWe didn't accept social invitations because we couldn't afford to bring a bottle of wine. Nor could we afford to reciprocate.\n\nThose were hard times. But we had a goal. Which was to get out of debt. And we were prepared to make whatever sacrifices were required to reach that goal.\n\nRegarding copy. All the copy was written by us. I know nothing about those books you mentioned. Or special words.\n\nWe just told our story. And described the products in great detail. And offered everyone a no questions asked money back guarantee if they weren't happy. And a twelve-month wear and tear guarantee. Meaning. We guaranteed that whatever they purchased, they couldn't wear it out in twelve months.\n\nNo one else did that at the time. We were a first.

All the best! Click to expand...\n\nG'day again @Xeon,\n\nThank you! Appreciated.\n\nI do have a productocracy. And I'm aware of it. And admit to not knowing about the term until I read Unscripted.\n\nThis is the reason why.\n\nMy products are utilitarian. Each one solves a problem.\n\nPeople don't come to my website. Or order from me over the phone. For any reason other than they're looking for a solution to a problem they can't find elsewhere.\n\nAnd when they discover my products work. When others don't. They become very loyal customers. Because that in itself fills a need. Products that don't disappoint.\n\nThe fact that my products aren't sexy. Or trendy. But low tech. Rather than high tech. Works in my favour. I'm not a fad. But I'm very much a staple.\n\nAfter 24 years, I'm now receiving calls from customers worried that I've retired and they wouldn't be able to order. And after being relieved we're still in business, they tell me before they hang up that they're worried I'll retire before the product they're now purchasing wears out.\n\nIt's a compliment.\n\nThis loyalty has much to do with the quality of what we offer.\n\nBut it also has much to do with the love and attention we give to our customers. They come back because they remember how warm and welcoming we are every time they order. That's an intangible that can't be measured. But when someone tells me they still have my note that came with their parcel a few years ago, it's not hard to realise that these intangibles are what makes us memorable.\n\nForget the gimmicks. And the tricky words. Offer products that solve a genuine problem. Then talk to your customers from the heart. It's a sure-fire winner. ~Carol\u2764", "JasonR said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nThank you for sharing. It\u2019s people like you who share their stories that make me come back here.

We have 400,000 customers in 30 countries around the world who think our products are the best thing since sliced bread. The icing on the cake is that all our products are made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability. We are renown for our simple solutions that work. When others don't.\n\nThat's the event.\n\nThe process is this.\n\nIn 1992, my partner and I lost everything in Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating's 'recession we had to have'. We closed down two businesses. My partner's 12 year old architectural practice. My market research consultancy. We farewelled 16 loyal and supportive staff. We sold our home of 22 years. Two cars. And our personal possessions. To pay off what debt we could. And made a scheme of arrangement with our creditors to pay off the remaining debt.\n\nPoor as church mice. We left the city lights of Sydney Australia. For a rural life in a remote village with no internet access. No email. Not even call waiting. But it met our most important criteria. We could live in a farmhouse whose rent we could afford to pay. The village was heavily affected by a severe drought. And the house was not a desirable place to live. But it was our safety net.\n\nWe made a decision to find our way back by utilising simple solutions. Our skills were in design. And research. So we reinvented ourselves as designers and makers of textile products. Our first product didn't capture the hearts of the marketplace. But our second product did. We redesigned the humble ironing board cover utilising a low tech solution to make sure it was firmly anchored to an ironing board. So it never moved. Which is what makes people hate ironing.\n\nIf you make one good product. Customers want more. So we designed 6 more textile products. And today we have more than 400,000 customers in 30 countries. Without any retail distribution. And all done online today. But in the beginning, it was all mail order.\n\nWe've been down dark alleys. Wondered if we were certifiably mad to keep doing what we were doing when ironing board covers are not top of mind with most people.\n\nBut we discovered they are very top of mind with men and women who must iron.\n\nEven though the subject is not sexy, our products, and our story, have been written about in every major publication in Australia.\n\nWe've been featured on mainstream TV. Interviewed on radio. Included in two books. The latest being 'Hunch' by international best selling author Bernadette Jiwa. I'm the 'Ironing Whisperer' on page 73.\n\nThe process of working every day is what got us to where we are today.\n\nWe did what everyone said we couldn't do. We built a worldwide business from broke. On a remote rural property. Before the internet and email came to our rural village.\n\nI'm here to mix with like minded men and women. I have 35 years of business experience to share. I've done the hard yards. And would love to be of help to those of you who can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAnd. I want to travel further along the road to wealth.\n\nIt will be a pleasure to meet you. ~Carol\u2764Click to expand...\n\n\nHi @Carol Jones ,\n\nMy husband suggested that I read this post, and I have to say... I am blown away. I am new to the forum, so I am still snooping around trying to find people who I can relate to/whose stories I can learn from, and you are a great inspiration!\n\nIn short, my husband and I are starting a business in performance-enhancing altheticwear and, like you and your partner, we are trying to be wise with our budgeting decisions. That said, I have a few basic questions for you:\n\n1. Why did you start off with mail-orders only? \n2. When and how did you know that it was time to call it quits on the first product? \n3.

How did you spread the word about your product in the early days?Click to expand...\n\nI'll answer question #2 first. Because that relates to my answer to question #1. And then question #3. Because that also relates to question #1.\n\n2. When and how did you know that it was time to call it quits on the first product?\n\nMy partner, Victor Pleshev, is an architect. Although the building industry was demolished in 'the recession we had to have'. He still had a strong desire to design.\n\nSo we turned to product design.\n\nWe knew nothing about product design. Which is why we chose to improve already existing products with his simple design solutions.\n\nOur first product was a dog collar. Called 'Dashing Dogs'.\n\nWe noticed that all the dog collars on the market were heavy. And stiff. And cut into the neck of one of our dogs. Who had short hair. A cheeky and gorgeous Dalmatian. Rescued by us after being dumped in our rural patch.\n\nBecause Victor understands strength. And tension. He designed a collar made of soft leather. Where two pieces of leather are crossed over each other at certain points. The crossover reinforced with a rivet. To make a whole collar. It was not only very strong. But very elegant.\n\nThis was 1993. Shortly after we left Sydney and moved to the rural property we were renting.\n\nWe sourced the leather ourselves in Sydney. From a tannery on Botany Bay.

This company was run by an old-style business gentleman. Who was 78. The writing was on the wall that he wouldn't be in business in the long term.\n\nVictor and I come from the service industry. Architecture. And me from the market research industry.\n\nWe knew absolutely NOTHING about getting products into the marketplace. We were the blind. Leading the blind.\n\nWe focussed on retailers. Who. We discovered. Were monumentally uninterested in these collars.\n\nThe pitifully few retailers who did stock them, had them ridiculed at the time, by the leader in dog collars in the pet industry. Their representatives, upon seeing the collars on the collar rack, telling the retailers they were not only too expensive, but were inferior quality dog collars. That would break in an instant. And beloved dogs who strain at the collars would be breaking free and running into traffic. Getting killed. \n\nThey really whipped up the horror stories. \n\nAll but one retailer returned stock. And asked to be reimbursed. The problem was, we had already spent the revenue we earned from those sales. And had no money to reimburse these retailers. So we told them, on advice from our solicitor, who was also a family friend, that as we hadn't signed any agreement regarding 'sale or return', we weren't legally obligated to reimburse them. And returned the collars to them. COD postage.\n\nThere was a glimmer of hope with veterinary practices. Which were just starting to sell pet accessories. Vets could see how good these collars were. And placed orders. And reorders.\n\nDistributors to veterinary practices weren't interested in our product. So we had to contact vets ourselves. Which was very slow.\n\nAnd.\n\nFinancially. We couldn't service them. \n\nTo secure orders, we had to send a free sample to every veterinary surgery. When we calculated how much this would cost. And what our expected return would be, we couldn't see how we could afford to do this without borrowing. And we couldn't borrow to develop this business.\n\nOn the plus side, pet shops paid on delivery of product. Long before we had to pay the tannery. The laser cutter. And the collar maker. \n\nVeterinary practices paid in 60 days. So we were always owing money to our suppliers before we got paid. With nothing left over to develop the business.\n\nSo we called it a day. Which was always going to be on the cards anyway. \n\nShortly afterwards, Our tannery was forced to close down because of air and water pollution problems. They rang us wanting to know if we would like to buy their leather at a factory closing down sale.\n\nAnd our maker of collars died. And no one was interested in continuing his business.\n\nHow strong were these collars? Our Dalmatian was still wearing his when he died 11 years later.\n\n3. How did you spread the word about your product in the early days?\n\nAfter our experience with retailers, we concluded they know little. Or nothing. About the products they sell. And are rarely interested in selling something that's different because 'me too' products, that require no explanation, are much easier to sell. \n\nAnd. To be honest. They weren't a group of people we could develop a personal relationship with. \n\nThey were mainly interested in how much money they could make from each supplier. They weren't really interested in us. Or in most of their suppliers. And would cut short most telephone conversations. There was nothing in it for them to develop a personal relationship.\n\nWe had no money for advertising, so we hit the road. Spruiking about our products anywhere we could set up a microphone. We demonstrated why our Fitz Like A Glove\u2122 Ironing Board Cover was different to everything else on the market. And told our story loud enough for passers-by to hear. Who rewarded us by buying our products.\n\nI had never spruiked before. Was horrified at the thought. But an experienced gal in the agricultural show business stopped at our stall. Showed me how to do it. Convinced me sales would soar if I got the attention of passersby. And on my first spruik, I scored a sale of 3 covers from a passerby! I was hooked. And never looked back.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2008, we travelled at least 60,000kms per year. Spruiking. And selling.\n\nBecause I have a history with direct marketing, I was educated about the value of a name and an address. (No internet. No email. In 1994). I asked everyone who purchased if they would like to become part of my mailing list. To keep in touch. And had forms available for them to fill out their details. A surprisingly high 80% said yes.   \n\n1. Why did you start off with mail-orders only?\n\nThe above is why. And how. I started my mailorder business.\n\nAs soon as we returned from an event, I wrote a handwritten thank you note to everyone who gave me their name and address. It was a simple note. Saying how much I loved the fact they chose us above everyone else. I also included a photocopied brochure. Asking them to save it for future orders. Or to pass it on to a friend or family member.\n\nAnd once a year we mailed a brochure, run off our photocopier, to these names and addresses. And built up a mailing list that's in the tens of thousands today.\n\nWhen the internet arrived in our rural village in February 2001, we were ready. And launched our internet site on day 1. With the help of marketing students from Charles Sturt University in Bathurst NSW. Our closest regional centre. They were happy to take us on for free as a class project. And we benefitted from their enthusiasm.\n\nBy 2008, our internet business had grown to the stage where we were receiving more orders online than the volume of product we were selling at events. The internet was international. Events were local.\n\nSo we hung up our car keys. And the wheels of our car did a little jig!\n\nMay I say first, Kristin, if you already have funds to start your business, you're so much further ahead than we were. We had nothing.\n\nHow you spend them is dependent on your goals. What you want to achieve in the short term. And the long term.\n\nI know nothing about the market for athletic wear, but I'll ask you some questions.\n\nWhat are your long-term goals? And short-term goals?\n\nDo your short-term goals segue into your long-term goals?\n\nDoes your athletic wear need to be explained? Or are the benefits obvious?\n\nHow different is it to other athletic wear? And why? \n\nWhy did you develop it? What need are you addressing that other athletic wear doesn't? Or can't?\n\nDo you want to wholesale to on-sellers?\n\nOr do you want to develop personal relationships with customers one-on-one?\n\nIt's hard to have both relationships.\n\nOn-sellers view your own retail site as competition. And they will often discount your product. Leaving you vulnerable in your one-on-one relationships. Customers today shop around. Voraciously. They know where the bargains are. Which is why no one else sells my products except me.\n\nAs far as helping you further is concerned, I only know about my business. And how to run it. \n\nMy values are not often aligned with the values of other people. In the short term, I'm more interested in building love and loyalty. Because I know the money will follow that. It's not the priorities of most people. And may not be a priority that you can afford to indulge in right now.\n\nWhen it comes to your next step, there are members of this forum who are eminently more qualified than me to give you advice. And I'm sure there will be an abundance of good advice proffered.\n\nIt's been a pleasure to meet you, Kristin. I'm touched that you would ask me these questions. And I wish you and your husband only the very best. ~Carol\u2764", "Carol Jones said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nGood morning @Kristin R from Oz,\n\nA big thank you to you and your husband for taking the time to read such a long thread! I'll answer your questions in as much detail as possible.\n\nAnd no. You're not repeating yourself as no one else has asked me these questions before.\n\n\n\nI'll answer question #2 first. Because that relates to my answer to question #1. And then question #3. Because that also relates to question #1.\n\n2. When and how did you know that it was time to call it quits on the first product?\n\nMy partner, Victor Pleshev, is an architect. Although the building industry was demolished in 'the recession we had to have'. He still had a strong desire to design.\n\nSo we turned to product design.\n\nWe knew nothing about product design. Which is why we chose to improve already existing products with his simple design solutions.\n\nOur first product was a dog collar. Called 'Dashing Dogs'.\n\nWe noticed that all the dog collars on the market were heavy. And stiff. And cut into the neck of one of our dogs. Who had short hair. A cheeky and gorgeous Dalmatian. Rescued by us after being dumped in our rural patch.\n\nBecause Victor understands strength. And tension. He designed a collar made of soft leather. Where two pieces of leather are crossed over each other at certain points. The crossover reinforced with a rivet. To make a whole collar. It was not only very strong. But very elegant.\n\nThis was 1993. Shortly after we left Sydney and moved to the rural property we were renting.\n\nWe sourced the leather ourselves in Sydney. From a tannery on Botany Bay. Tanneries are a very dirty, highly poisonous place to work. And pollute the waterways on which they're located.\n\nBut it was still legal to operate a tannery in Australia then.\n\nWe had the leather tanned to our specifications and cut by laser to Victor's design.\n\nAnd the leather pieces were then given to a company who braided them together into the collars.

The story of your dog collar endeavor was very helpful and interesting. I bet your sweet dog loved his collar as did others whose owners made the purchase. It\u2019s too bad that the chips fell as they did, because it seems like you really did create a valuable product. Obviously, things turned around for you though!\n\nThe interactions that you have had with retailers are very eye-opening. I will definitely keep your experience in mind to avoid similar conflicts in the future\u2026\n\nHow awesome that you were approached by someone who helped you spruik! I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ve ever heard of that word, but I can infer what it means by the context.  The idea of  spruiking is not very appealing to me, either, but I do think that it could be a tool for @Greg R  and I in the beginning.\n\nHow did you end up getting the attention of passerby\u2019s? I have done something like this once, and I remember feeling so awkward trying to get people to notice my booth.\n\nWe have started to tap into online advertising, which has the potential to grab the mases. Still, I do like the idea of a little face-to-face promotion. There is definitely something to be said for creating relationships and showing the consumer a tangible item that they can interact with it. Perhaps we will try a healthy mix of both online and in-person\u2026\n\nLong term, we want to be endorsed by a major female athlete.\n\nShort term, we want to generate sales from active females of all kinds. I can go into further detail in a private message if that\u2019s okay with you!\n\nThe product is self-explanatory, but there may be some variations that will need to be explained, which we plan to do on our website and in ads. We are creating something that is different than anything currently out there. We consider the product to be a unique improvement on an existing product.\n\nWhen it comes to wholesale versus direct-to-consumer, I THINK we are leaning towards more towards the direct-to-consumer path. It is definitely something to evaluate. I sincerely appreciate that you have taken the time to answer my questions. Your answers have sparked a lot of thoughts and questions in my head, and I am very grateful for the information.\n\nI hope to report back to you in the near future with new developments!\n\nCheers,\nKristin", "Carol Jones said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nI can't abide rudeness.

Not so much to sell. But to get the reaction from the interested public as to what you're presenting to them.\n\nIf you are prepared to ask the right questions, rather than launch into sell mode, this is where you will learn what to tell visitors to your website about your product.\n\nQuestions to ask are. And you always start out with their story first.\n\nWhat active wear do they currently have?\n\nWhat do they like about it?\n\nWhat don't they like about it?\n\nHow did they find out about it?\n\nIs it comfortable?\n\nWhatever else you think is important. These questions will evolve and change as you become more experienced in selling your product.\n\nWhen assessing this information, then ask them if you can show them your product. And ask for feedback.\n\nDo they like it?\n\nExactly why? What are all the features they like?\n\nWhat are the benefits to them?\n\nHow do they think they will feel wearing your range? (This is the emotion you want to elicit. Emotion is what sells.)\n\nWhy not? Can they elaborate as to why not?\n\nAnd go from there.\n\nAt the end of all this, you will either sell to them at your event. Without having to ask. Or you won't. But if you don't, you will know why. Which most businesses never know. Why someone doesn't buy. And it's rarely ever about price.\n\n\n\nKristin R said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nLong term, we want to be endorsed by a major female athlete.Click to expand...\n\nThat's a plus. But expensive.

It's not personally rewarding. But for many, it's lucrative. And not as time-consuming.\n\nOn the downside, if an establishment drops you, there goes your income from them. And then you have to scramble to replace it.\n\nFinding your own customers. Like we did. Is much more difficult. And means you are constantly looking for new markets.\n\nBut that, to me, is the challenge of being in business.\n\nI've spent more than 15 years looking for a key to unlock a door that was akin to breaking into Fort Knox. I finally found it. And find myself in the position of being able to offer my product range - exclusively - no competitors - to a membership list of 36,000 men and women who iron. It's the equivalent of a captive audience.\n\nI am so very excited.\n\nWhat was attractive to this organisation is that I've no presence in retail stores. So what I'm offering their members is the ability to buy products that are not readily available to their members elsewhere. And once they purchase my ironing board cover. There are 5 other products they can also purchase.\n\nThat is what excited the directors of this organisation.\n\nBusinesses walk on both sides of the street.\n\nWholesaling.\n\nAnd selling direct to customers.\n\nHow you get your product into the marketplace is totally dependent on what is personally the best fit for you. And what sort of relationships you want to build into your business life.\n\nI'm delighted I was of help, Kristin. And please keep me in the loop. You can contact me anytime with a personal message.

But he feels obligated to stay. Without interfering. Just to stop me from being arrested.\n\nWhen we first started out, we were working with a company on our first product.\n\nWhen we arrived to pick up the finished product, it was a complete stuff up.\n\nThe owner of the company, which was a relatively small company, took no responsibility. He simply blamed the problem on an employee.\n\nI snapped. Got up on my soapbox. And pointed out to him that as the owner of the company, the buck stopped with him. And how dare he be spineless and accuse an employee. When he assured us he would be in charge of quality control.\n\nThat was just for starters.\n\nI actually don't remember the rest.\n\nVictor told me I was so angry, he was ready to pull me off the owner. Just in case it was necessary.\n\nWhen he could get a word in edgewise, the owner assured us the problem would be fixed by 3pm.\n\nWhen we returned at 3pm, Victor politely asked me to stay in the car. Which I did.\n\nWhen he met with the owner, the owner looked around. And asked where 'she' was. Victor assured him 'she' was locked in the car. For his safety.\n\nHe then proceeded to commiserate with Victor about having to deal with a 'sheila' like me every day. \n\nWe found another supplier.\n\nIt's a pleasure to exchange stories, Gary.

Or what you did.\n\nI've read about half of your thread and stopped. So I could share with you where I am with puzzles.\n\nI'm an amateur photographer. With - fortunately - a very good eye. I can quickly frame a photo and know it's going to be a good shot. I also have an exceptionally good long range, superzoom digital camera. Which you need when you're photographing wildlife in the distance. Which are always on the move.\n\nI live and work from my remote 54 hectare (135 acres) beautiful rural property that's located in the hill country of a very picturesque part of rural Australia. On the east coast.\n\nEvery morning at sunrise, I talk a walk on my property. With my camera around my neck. Photograph what I see. And choose one photo every morning to post to my social media accounts.\n\nBecause we emphasise that we are a rural business, I also use my photos on my website. In all my newsletters. And in my emails to customers and prospects.\n\nI've been taking these photos since 2012. And have hundreds of thousands stored on my desktop.\n\nI receive enough compliments on a regular basis regarding the photos, to know they're very appealing to people. And are often asked the following:\n\nCan I purchase one as wall art? No. I don't have the facility to produce them. Nor do I want to.\n\nWill I do a calendar? No. The online world is awash with calendars.\n\nWhat about a book of your photos? No. Too expensive. \n\nTea towels? That doesn't really excite me.\n\nFridge magnets? No. I can't see that being a good market for me.\n\nCards. That's a maybe. But how many people send cards these days?\n\nWhat stopped me in my tracks this February was a customer. Who told me that every time I post a photo of the kangaroos that roam my land, her grandchildren, whom she looks after 3 days a week while their mother and father go out to work, are mesmerised by their images. Being an artist, and a dedicated grandmother who is besotted with her grandchildren, she asked me if I had ever thought about turning my photos into puzzles for young children.\n\nEspecially as the wildlife that I photograph - kangaroos, exotic birds, wild goats, sheep that my neighbour agists onto my property, my neighbour's horses -  are rarely seen by children in the city. \n\nThat idea excited me! Because. I'm a jigsaw puzzle fan. Have been since my parents gave me a jigsaw puzzle as a child.\n\nIt's also an excellent way to use my photographs. And a different way to generate revenue from them.\n\nI already have a cultivated market for grandchildren. My customers. Who are mature. Many of them grandparents. Who could see them as a perfect gift for their grandchildren.\n\nI'm 3 weeks into this venture. And this is where I am at right now.\n\nWe are dedicated to having everything we offer to the public made in Australia. Our quality. And made in Austalia. Are major selling points for us.\n\nI didn't think that puzzle making was a big venture in Oz. But my partner, Victor, did a quick scan of Google and found several pages of makers here.\n\nMost of the puzzle makers do one-off personal puzzles. They will turn any photo into a puzzle. Your wedding. Favourite photo of your child. A special event. Becomes a puzzle. \n\nWhat an eye-opener that was for us.\n\nSo that was hurdle number one jumped.\n\nMy interest in photography is in the morning walk. And the taking of the photos. And posting them to my social media accounts. \n\nI'm not particularly interested in curating my photos. But Victor is very interested. He's been at me for several years to do something constructive with them. When he sees an exceptionally good photo, he says, 'that's one for the wall.' \n\nAnd he's also excited by the puzzle venture.\n\nHe's talked to several puzzle makers. And has chosen one he thinks is more suitable for us. Especially as they specialise in puzzles for children. They make puzzles for the Department of Education for young children.\n\nThey can make puzzles that are 30 large pieces. Or 60 smaller pieces. They also make 500 piece puzzles. And 1000 piece puzzles.\n\nAnd they also have no minimum purchase requirement. One puzzle is fine for them.\n\nIt's a husband and wife team who showed more interest in our venture than the other puzzle makers. And are more than happy for Victor to send them a photo. Which they will make into a puzzle. And send to us as a sample.\n\nBecause we don't know if this will be successful or not, Victor wants to offer the puzzles on our website as custom made-to-order only. So we're not holding stock. Customers can choose their puzzle from 'X' number of photos.\n\nThis puzzle maker has a guaranteed 2-day turnaround time per order. And is happy to mail direct to our customer. Which means we're eliminating one cost. Which is the Australia Post charge to get the puzzles to us. And then us to mail to our customer. Australia Post is one of the most expensive postal services in the world. And double posting is dead money.\n\nWhether we do that depends on how the product is presented when we open the parcel. I'm very fussy about the fact that when customers open a parcel from me, it should be akin to receiving a gift in the mail. So we'll see about that one.\n\nVictor has cast his architect's eye over the photos. He's also a very talented pencil artist. So his eye is more critical than mine would be. Has chosen about 50 that he thinks will work. And is ready to send a photo to the puzzle maker. For us to receive a sample.\n\nIf I was doubtful before I read your posts. And I was. As we all are when we start a new venture. I'm not now. Your thread has convinced me this is a genuine opportunity. And I'm looking forward to receiving the sample.\n\nBeing in this business for 24 years, I also know that disappointment is just around the corner regarding companies who make things. And I hope this puzzle maker doesn't disappoint. Because then we're back to square one. \n\nI was particularly taken by your comment about puzzle dust. And is definitely something I will be looking for.\n\nThank you, Jason, for your thread. It's been very enlightening. And encouraging.

Do you teach your disabled employees how to sew or do send them to a local instructor?Click to expand...\n\nThank you, Greg Rutkowsi. That's an excellent question.\n\nWe are a very small family business. And when we realised that our ironing board cover was becoming too big a venture to stay on our dining room table, we looked for a company to sew for us.\n\nSeveral threw us out because we were too fussy.\n\nAll we wanted was for our product to be made with love and care.\n\nWe rang the Industrial Supplies Office in NSW. The state we live in. And asked them if they knew a company in our rural region. Who employed men and women with a disability. Who could sew for us.\n\nThey said they would be back in touch within two hours.\n\nTrue to their word they did. And introduced us to our sewing company. Who we have been in partnership with for 23 years.\n\nPeople with a disability need special training. Including medical care on site. Counselling when they have meltdowns. And the infrastructure to care for them. Which is beyond our means.\n\nWe know each of the men and women who sew for us personally. We visit each person when we visit our sewing company. And thank them for what they do for us.\n\nThese are very special people who love to work. And we tell our customers. And visitors to our website. That our products are made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability.\n\nThe care they put into the making of our products shows. Over the years, they have made millions of items for us. To date, we have only had one product returned because of a manufacturing fault. They truly love what they do. And make sure they put their heart and soul into every product they make. And of course. It shows.\n\nOur sewers have epilepsy. Are autistic. Have mild brain damage. Some self harm. But they love to work. When we visit, they wave to us. And if they have a break, they tell us what they've been doing since the last time we saw them. We absolutely adore them. \n\nBecause it takes so long to train someone who has mild brain damage. We are unable to change the design of our product. Without it causing mayhem at our sewing company. \n\nSo before we turn a product over to them, we make the first 500 ourselves. So we're sure about the design. And know that it's as perfect as it will ever be. \n\nSome consider this a downside. We consider it an advantage. By the time we've handed over a product for making to them, we know we've considered all the options. We consult with them about what their sewers are capable of doing.

As soon as the going gets tough, they pick up their marbles and go elsewhere.\n\nWhen Bernadette Jiwa interviewed me for her new book 'Hunch', she asked me why we persevered. I said it was a no brainer. We were broke. We didn't have two pennies to rub together. My partner designed the ironing board cover for his mother purely as a gift. Never as a product. We were amazed that all her friends wanted one. Having no $$$ in our pockets, we made 20 and sold them to her friends. 20 became 40. And before we knew it, we had made and sold 500 ironing board covers. Even we had to admit that this was now a business.\n\nI remember the first Easter after we launched the cover two months previously. We were still very broke. Victor and I were standing in an aisle in the supermarket, trying to decide how many rolls of toilet paper we could afford to buy after we bought dog and cat food. Not far from us were two sisters buying expensive chocolate Easter eggs for their family. I did a mental calculation that those eggs cost them about $200. And here we were trying to divvy up $30 between pet food and toilet paper. I had to leave the supermarket because I was almost in tears.\n\nThose gut wrenching low moments are when people cave in and get a job. We didn't want a job. So we had no other option other than to go forward.\n\nI still pinch myself at where we are today. All the sacrifices and low moments were worth it.

And for me, it's an honour to be here.\n\nFor me and my partner, success came in very small steps. It seems we spent a long time in the wilderness before we saw a beam of sunlight.\n\nIt wasn't until we took our noses away from the coalface to reflect on where we were that we realised we had hundreds of thousands of customers. In 30 countries! That our story and our products had been written about in every major publication in Australia. That we had very high profile customers who were appreciative of our efforts. And that the best business decision we made was to have our products made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability.\n\nThe second best business decision we made was to listen to our customers instead of the gurus. Our customers gave us incredible feedback. And every bit of constructive criticism was used to change our business. And because customers cared enough to give us advice, we have a better business - and website - because of the changes we made to please them.\n\nAll of the above happened one. at. a. time. Over several years. There was no big burst of success. And I think this is where most of us get derailed. We're so busy trying to get from A to B. That we don't reflect often enough along the journey.\n\nI do pinch myself when I realise how far we've come. We purchased the run-down 54 hectare rural sheep property we were renting. And turned it into a wildlife sanctuary. We removed the sheep and let the native trees and grasses regenerate. Which attracted birds. 120 species so far. And still counting.\n\nWe converted the barren hectare of paddock that surrounds the farmhouse into a stunning garden. We planted 110 trees to give us shade from the hot Australian sun. Planted thousands of fragrant shrubs as understory and habitat for small birds. Planted over 200 fragrant roses to ramble along the fences. And smothered the farmhouse with honeysuckle that scrambles along the roofline that not only shades the verandas. But permeates the air with its intense fragrance in summer.\n\nWe started this garden 20 years ago. Only planting tubestock and cuttings from friends and neighbours. Which was all we could afford. We could barely see the plants 20 years ago. They were the size of toothpicks when we planted them.\n\nWe've lost half the garden twice to severe drought. And when we replanted, we used only those plants that survived the extreme and harsh weather conditions we have here.\n\nToday, we have a mature garden that is the envy of our friends. And customers.\n\nAgain, all of this is done one thing at a time. And it's been traumatic losing plantings to severe weather conditions. But we wanted a big country garden. So kept replanting until we have the showpiece garden of today.\n\nAnd it's only on reflection that we become aware of how far we've travelled. The journey has been exceptional. And worth making.\n\nAnd I'm looking forward to the next phase. As a member of The Fastlane Forum. \n\nAgain, MJ, thank you for your very kind words. They are truly appreciated. ~Carol\u2764", "MarekvBeek said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nHey Carol,\n\nNice to hear your story. Thank you for sharing.\n\nAre you still working full time now?

I'm very much working full time.\n\nOther projects? Definitely. I want to use the credibility and goodwill I've built up with my customer base over 23 years to transition to other things. I'm not sure what that will be. I have an open mind. But whatever it is, it has to be something that is beneficial to the environment. And which helps other people. Although $$$$ is important. It won't be about making money. But more a case of the $$$$ following the cause.\n\nI'm here because I'm looking for options. And want to meet like minded men and women.\n\nWhy share my story?\n\nBecause every entrepreneur has been where we've been. Perhaps not flat broke. But close to it.\n\nAnd many give up before they give themselves a chance. And don't have the courage when they're really struggling to stand up to the flak they get from family and friends because they haven't reached 'success' in the time frame determined by other people.\n\nWe've been there.\n\nVictor's parents are a good example. \"How come my son, the architect, is now a purveyor of ironing board covers\"? They couldn't understand that the 'recession we had to have' decimated the building industry. There was no work for architects for 10 years in Australia. And. They were embarrassed at telling their friends that their son made ironing board covers. Instead of designing tall buildings.\n\nThey also couldn't resign themselves to the fact that before the recession we were a very wealthy business couple. With a high profile in the Sydney Australia business community. I was on 3 boards of directors. And Victor was the developers' dream architect.\n\nAnd afterwards. We were flat broke. With no real prospects for earning an income. I'm sure it caused them a great deal of personal pain.\n\nFriends. Perhaps mean well. But were insistent that we get a job. Rather than fiddle around with something so trivial as an ironing board cover. \"Who irons anyway? Doesn't everyone hate it?\"\n\nOur accountant. \"You're not making enough money. You can't start a business in the depths of the worst recession Australia's ever had. Why don't you both just knuckle under and get a real job?\"\n\nAnd then the strangers we meet. \"You really make a living out of selling ironing board covers\"? Well not yet. But we will!\n\nThen there's the disapproval from people because the product isn't sexy. Glamourous. High tech. The fact that people who are serious about ironing think it's the best thing since sliced bread doesn't matter.\n\nThe banks. \"We can't lend you money. Nobody irons. Who are you going to sell to\"? How about the 400,000 men and women in 30 countries? Just as starters.\n\nThe disapproval. And flak. Comes from all directions. And entrepreneurs starting out need to know they have to have a spine of steel to withstand the assault. And once you get over the hump, and realise your dream is possible, life doesn't get easy. But your faith and confidence in yourself increases. You become more focused on where you want to be. And more determined to get there.\n\nOnce you reach that stage, you start to stand up to your dissenters. And put them in their place. Including family.\n\nThat's why I want to share my story.

How did you keep motivating yourself not tolisten to those around you and quit going for your dreams, despite the obvious risks and your (at the time) very recent experiences of failure?Click to expand...\n\nG'day @Laughingman21 ,\n\nThank you! That's fabulous feedback.\n\nWhat you read is me. I talk to everyone like this. When my customers ring - which they don't do as often as I'd like : online shopping is so seductive - we have very long conversations about what's happening in their world. We trade stories. Their experiences. My experiences. I look at situations not as problems. But as opportunities to offer solutions.\n\nA customer who always ordered online rang recently to place an order. I asked her how she was. She blurted out that her husband had died not so long ago. We chatted for an hour. About how confronting it is to lose someone suddenly. Who she depended on. And the problems she had to overcome. Especially as she also lived on a rural property. We discussed all the things that can go wrong. Water pumps stop working. Blocked gutters need to be kept clean because they're the source of water that goes into the tanks.\n\nBecause of all the people I talk to, I'm able to put myself in their shoes. And discuss their problems in a way that they know I understand what they're talking about.\n\nWhen she hung up she paid me the best compliment ever. She said she rang to order a cover. And ended the call discovering she found a friend who she could talk to.\n\nThat's all most people want. Someone who will listen to them. And who can feel their pain.\n\nTo your question about the constant advice to stay in the slow lane.\n\nHow did we get through it?\n\nWith difficulty.\n\nOur decision to leave Sydney and move to the bush was two pronged. First. It truly was the only place we could afford to live.\n\nSecond. Victor needed to get away from the fear his parents wanted to envelop him with.\n\nAs a business couple, Victor and I had a very high profile in the Sydney business community. I was on 3 boards of directors. Victor was the dream architect all developers loved. We had a gorgeous terrace house in the trendy inner city suburb of Balmain. Before the building industry came crashing down on top of us, life was good.\n\nVictor's parents personal pain at our loss was palpable.\n\nEspecially as his father was Australia's leading coal mining engineer in coal preparation plants. He was an industry giant at the time. Extremely well respected for his knowledge and skills. Not only in Australia. But overseas as well.\n\nHis parents were very wealthy. And they intuitively knew how big and devastating our loss was. As parents, they wanted to wrap us in cotton wool. To protect us from any further hurt.\n\nThey had a house in the country which they offered to us to live in. Free. But I instinctively knew this would be a bad decision.\n\nWe relocated to a totally different area. In the opposite direction. A four hour drive between them and us was enough of a barrier for them to not constantly be on our doorstep.\n\nBut then there's the telephone. The nightly calls from his worried mother became a nuisance that we just had to live with. She so wanted Victor to find a job.\n\nFortunately, Victor wasn't influenced by his parents. He knew our vision. Which wasn't much of a vision. Reinvent ourselves so that we could earn an income. And start getting out of debt. Without succumbing to getting a job. That was about as detailed as the vision was.\n\nTo be truthful, if Victor had been swayed by his parents, we wouldn't be together now. It would have been a wedge driven between us.\n\nBut the opposite happened. This catastrophe joined us at the hip. And although we disagreed on many things. We never disagreed about how united we were. And that's how we resolved all our problems. Compromise comes in many guises.\n\n25 years later we are still united at the hip. And still disagree about many things. We live and work together 24 hours a day! But what unites us is far deeper than what we disagree about. And we have a shared history of experiences that few other couples possess.\n\nThe constant flak and disapproval about our low brow product amongst people in general - who irons? all covers are rubbish! - did affect us. And surprised us.\n\nWhenever the flak became too intense, I always told Victor that the people we should be listening to are our customers. The people who put their money on the table. Not the people who would never use our product. And who had no idea of what it was like to start a business from scratch.\n\nThis was the era of the dot com boom. Sexy and high tech was in. Functional and low tech was not.\n\nAnd guess who's still in business when they're not!\n\nYou do need to have a spine of steel when enduring such criticism. And disparagement. And an enormous, unshakeable, belief that this is what you want to do. And that your product choice is spot on.\n\nEvery time we were tempted to throw in the towel, we'd say. OK. Now what do we do next? Nothing materialised. And as time went on. It became more difficult to toss away all the hard work we were putting into our customer service. And the friendships we were developing with our customers. And the six other products we were developing because customers wanted more of our quality and Victor's intuitive designs.\n\nWhen the Sydney Morning Herald wrote an article about us in 2002 in their lifestyle magazine, Domain. When we sold $25K worth of product as a result of that article that lasted 24 hours. But was kept by people for months. It was our breakthrough moment.\n\nAll our friends saw it. Victor's family and their friends saw it. And suddenly we weren't so low brow, down market. We had butlers from big houses order. A few Sirs and Dames. Australia's richest woman at the time placed an order. A smattering of celebrities. Solicitors and barristers. Throw in a 5 star hotel. This magazine was high brow. And these people all lived in salubrious suburbs.\n\nThe journalist who wrote the article was one of the few journalists we came across who ironed. He agreed to receive a cover from us to test drive. Which he did. He also gave it to a few friends to test drive.\n\nWhat did the article say? It was a full page. Complete with photos of the product. But the killer words were: \"This is beyond a doubt the Rolls Royce of ironing board covers\".\n\n8 years after we started wandering in the wilderness, we were an overnight success!\n\nHow many journalists turned us down when we asked them to write a story about our cover? Over a hundred. We were like JK Rowling getting turned down by every book publisher. Except the last one.\n\nTenacity. Persistence. Self belief. A united front between you and your significant other. They go a long way towards overcoming the obstacles. Not everyone has those traits. But those of us who do are the fortunate ones who get to travel in the fast lane.\n\nThank you for asking! ~Carol\u2764", "Nigel B said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nTotally agree - such a contrast to those who arrive just wanting to take ...Click to expand...\n\nG'day @Nigel B.

We have 400,000 customers in 30 countries around the world who think our products are the best thing since sliced bread. The icing on the cake is that all our products are made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability. We are renown for our simple solutions that work. When others don't.\n\nThat's the event.\n\nThe process is this.\n\nIn 1992, my partner and I lost everything in Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating's 'recession we had to have'. We closed down two businesses. My partner's 12 year old architectural practice. My market research consultancy. We farewelled 16 loyal and supportive staff. We sold our home of 22 years. Two cars. And our personal possessions. To pay off what debt we could. And made a scheme of arrangement with our creditors to pay off the remaining debt.\n\nPoor as church mice. We left the city lights of Sydney Australia. For a rural life in a remote village with no internet access. No email. Not even call waiting. But it met our most important criteria. We could live in a farmhouse whose rent we could afford to pay. The village was heavily affected by a severe drought. And the house was not a desirable place to live. But it was our safety net.\n\nWe made a decision to find our way back by utilising simple solutions. Our skills were in design. And research. So we reinvented ourselves as product designers and makers of textile products. Our first product didn't capture the hearts of the marketplace. But our second product did. We redesigned the humble ironing board cover utilising a low tech solution to make sure it was firmly anchored to an ironing board. So it never moved. Which is what makes people hate ironing.\n\nIf you make one good product. Customers want more. So we designed 6 more textile products. And today we have more than 400,000 customers in 30 countries. Without any retail distribution. And all done online today. But in the beginning, it was all mail order.\n\nWe've been down dark alleys. Wondered if we were certifiably mad to keep doing what we were doing when ironing board covers are not top of mind with most people.\n\nBut we discovered they are very top of mind with men and women who must iron.\n\nEven though the subject is not sexy, our products, and our story, have been written about in every major publication in Australia.\n\nWe've been featured on mainstream TV. Interviewed on radio. Included in two books. The latest being 'Hunch' by international best selling author Bernadette Jiwa. I'm the 'Ironing Whisperer' on page 73.\n\nThe process of working every day is what got us to where we are today.\n\nWe did what everyone said we couldn't do. We built a worldwide business from broke. On a remote rural property. Before the internet and email came to our rural village.\n\nI'm here to mix with like minded men and women. I have 35 years of business experience to share. I've done the hard yards. And would love to be of help to those of you who can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAnd. I want to travel further along the road to wealth.\n\nIt will be a pleasure to meet you. ~Carol\u2764Click to expand...\n\nFellow Australian congratulating you on your business success.

I think my failure on these points has cost me $100k plus (unnecessarily) and more importantly 18 months in having a better business model.Click to expand...\n\nG'day @codonnell ,\n\nThank you for your comment. It's always a delight to meet another Australian.\n\nFirst. We never do anything cheaply. We're selling quality. So our product utilises first-class materials. And when the price goes up, we increase the price of our product. I've never noticed we've lost customers. And this is obviously something you agree with.\n\nI also don't skimp on the essentials for our business. We've had the same suppliers for 23 years. I don't chop and change. Or look for the cheapest price. My loyalty to my suppliers pays off in spades when I need them to move mountains for me in an emergency. As I did recently when the new premier hotel in Tasmania, Macq01, wanted 126 ironing board covers for their boards in a short time frame. So they would be on the boards for opening day.\n\nI willingly pay for quality software that runs my business. Which means I don't have glitches that cost time. And money.\n\nMy accountant is top notch. His advice has been incomparable.\n\nI'm a firm believer that you get what you pay for. And for me. Paying for quality saves time. And money. In the long term.\n\nWe keep our profit margins low. Which discourages anyone who is tempted to copy us. To begin with, the Fitz Like A Glove\u2122 Ironing Board Cover is a pain in the bum to make. Fiddly. With 13 accessories to source.\n\nPeople copy you because they can make your product cheaper. And maker greater profits. In our case, the profit margin just isn't there to make it worth their while.\n\nAlso. We're not me too products. All our products are unique. There is nothing else like them to compare with. And they are all protected by copyright design.\n\nSecond. We've also made many mistakes. But looking back 23 years, I would never again ask. And pay. Experts. For their advice.\n\nWe asked Charles Sturt University's marketing department in Bathurst NSW for advice. Their recommendation? That we be corporate. And edgy. And make our products in China.\n\nThat's not who we are. And is not the image we want to project. We're a rural business. And very much down to earth. And that's the image our customers love.\n\nVictor is Russian. I'm an ex-pat American. Both immigrants to Australia. The last thing we want to do is export jobs to other countries. Our loyalties are to Australia. The best business decision we ever made was to have our products made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability.\n\nEarly on, we sought advice from the Manufacturing Council Of Australia. They appointed us an 'Angel'. As an Australian, you would know who he was. He lied to us. Totally misled us. He was only interested in lining his pockets with the grant the Council gave us. To pay him. He told us 'XYZ' company was very interested in our product. When we rang, we were horrified to hear that they told him they had no interest in our product. And please don't call them again. That happened 7 times in a row. We were shattered.\n\nWe have a litany of bad advice from 'experts'. All revolving around. Sell it cheaper. There is a dearth of 'experts' who know how to sell on quality.\n\nTalk to people in our industry? They all make ironing board covers the same way. We are a breakthrough design. We rang Hills Industries. Who make ironing boards. We sent them a cover. Their marketing manager rang to tell us our cover was the best they had ever seen. We asked them if they would distribute our cover for us. Absolutely not, they said. Their prediction? We'll be lucky to sell 250 covers. Tops. We have more than 400,000 customers in 30 countries.\n\nOur experience is that everyone sells cheaply. Because it's the easy way out.\n\nWe taught ourselves to sell on quality. It's harder. And takes longer to get traction. But we are so experienced at that now, that we don't worry about price. We only put it up when we have to. The last price increase we had was in 2014. By keeping our profit margins low, we discourage competition. And we develop a loyal customer base. Who are aware that they're getting value for money.\n\nThe second best business decision we made was to listen to our customers. They care enough to give us constructive criticism. We have implemented every change they've asked us to make. In running our business. And regarding our website. We have a better. And stronger business. Because of them. They're paying us. And deserve our attention when they make recommendations.\n\nI don't agree that doing things as cheaply as possible is a good business strategy. There's always someone who can be cheaper than you. When you offer superior quality. You're offering value that people don't get elsewhere. And it's hard to compete with that.\n\nMake no mistake, Codonnell, we are very well aware of the fact that we are the ironing board cover of last choice. Customers will always try the cheapest first. But when those cheap covers let them down. Time after time. They finally buy ours. And we have them for life. As one customer told me recently, \"I was always looking for the ultimate cover. And never found it until I purchased yours\". We hear that over. And over.\n\nThis applies to all 7 of our products. Not one of them is the cheapest. But all of them are the best. Ever!\n\nWe always say that our products work. When others don't. And once they buy ours. They know what that means.\n\nOur values are giving the best ever possible to our customers. In terms of products. And customer service. To achieve that, we run our business on high octane fuel.\n\nThose are our values.\n\nWe're all different Codonnell. And we all have different objectives in running our businesses. What's right for me. Could be totally wrong for you.\n\nI hope this answers your questions. It's a pleasure to meet you. And thank you for your questions. They make me think of why we do what we do. Please feel free to ask more questions. ~Carol\u2764", "Could this be the first GOLD intro thread???", "Marked GOLD.\n\nThanks for being you Carol, and thanks for taking your time to show how to build a business ethically, and that's adds value to so many.", "Carol Jones said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\n8 years after we started wandering in the wilderness, we were an overnight success!Click to expand...\n\nLove it. @Andy Black was right to make this GOLD.\n\nHonestly this is one of the best Intro threads in the history of the forum.

We have 400,000 customers in 30 countries around the world who think our products are the best thing since sliced bread. The icing on the cake is that all our products are made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability. We are renown for our simple solutions that work. When others don't.\n\nThat's the event.\n\nThe process is this.\n\nIn 1992, my partner and I lost everything in Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating's 'recession we had to have'. We closed down two businesses. My partner's 12 year old architectural practice. My market research consultancy. We farewelled 16 loyal and supportive staff. We sold our home of 22 years. Two cars. And our personal possessions. To pay off what debt we could. And made a scheme of arrangement with our creditors to pay off the remaining debt.\n\nPoor as church mice. We left the city lights of Sydney Australia. For a rural life in a remote village with no internet access. No email. Not even call waiting. But it met our most important criteria. We could live in a farmhouse whose rent we could afford to pay. The village was heavily affected by a severe drought. And the house was not a desirable place to live. But it was our safety net.\n\nWe made a decision to find our way back by utilising simple solutions. Our skills were in design. And research. So we reinvented ourselves as product designers and makers of textile products. Our first product didn't capture the hearts of the marketplace. But our second product did. We redesigned the humble ironing board cover utilising a low tech solution to make sure it was firmly anchored to an ironing board. So it never moved. Which is what makes people hate ironing.\n\nIf you make one good product. Customers want more. So we designed 6 more textile products. And today we have more than 400,000 customers in 30 countries. Without any retail distribution. And all done online today. But in the beginning, it was all mail order.\n\nWe've been down dark alleys. Wondered if we were certifiably mad to keep doing what we were doing when ironing board covers are not top of mind with most people.\n\nBut we discovered they are very top of mind with men and women who must iron.\n\nEven though the subject is not sexy, our products, and our story, have been written about in every major publication in Australia.\n\nWe've been featured on mainstream TV. Interviewed on radio. Included in two books. The latest being 'Hunch' by international best selling author Bernadette Jiwa. I'm the 'Ironing Whisperer' on page 73.\n\nThe process of working every day is what got us to where we are today.\n\nWe did what everyone said we couldn't do. We built a worldwide business from broke. On a remote rural property. Before the internet and email came to our rural village.\n\nI'm here to mix with like minded men and women. I have 35 years of business experience to share. I've done the hard yards. And would love to be of help to those of you who can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAnd. I want to travel further along the road to wealth.\n\nIt will be a pleasure to meet you. ~Carol\u2764Click to expand...\n\nWelcome!  I'm really glad you're here.

It's truly appreciated.\n\nCustomers are the lifeblood of every business. There is no business without customers. \n\nI got my first job when I was 13 years old. Working in a department store on Saturdays in a small town in Virginia. Where my father was transferred.\n\nI'm an ex-pat American.\n\nI really wanted this job because I hated asking my parents for money to do things. I had an allowance. But in the eyes of a 13 year old, it was never large enough!\n\nThe owner of the department store didn't cut anyone any slack. If the staff weren't serving customers, they were fired and tossed out the door in front of everyone else.\n\nI discovered that I had a natural ability to love customers! Including black customers. This is the south. I'm from the north - New York City. And grew up without discrimination.\n\nBefore long, all the black customers were lining up. Waiting for me to serve them. Because I treated them with the same respect that I treated all customers. My parents, who had ears everywhere, would have given me a severe dressing down if they had heard I was disrespectful to anyone.\n\nMr Leggett, the owner of the department store, adored me. I worked for him until I left for university.\n\nI also had a babysitting business. To earn even more money. And I instinctively knew that being the ideal babysitter meant I was always booked.\n\nI love people. I also love serving them. That's what you do when you have a business. You serve people. And when they're happy, they reward you with friendship. They want to get to know me. And that leads to loyalty.\n\nI have somewhere on my website that we will walk over broken glass to make sure a customer is happy. And that's what we do.\n\nI have no sympathy for people who don't want to deal with customers. That's not how you build up a business. As a customer, I've been on the receiving end of that attitude. I never go back. If I can go elsewhere.\n\nYou should tell your clients that their disdain for customers will come back to bite them on the bum one day. Karma is always in play!\n\nI hope we stay in touch, The-J. It's been a delight to have you connect and comment. ~Carol\u2764", "Jon L said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nWelcome!

You're prepared to engage your market hand-to-hand.\n\nI live in the Republic of Ireland which isn't part of The UK, while Northern Ireland *is* part of The UK.  Which should mean no extra tarrif.\n\n\n\nJust to clarify, because it's not simple and because it might help with your previous second largest market:\n\nGreat Britain is England, Scotland, and Wales.  They all border each other.\n\nThe UK is short for \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\".  NI is part of The UK, and uses the pound as currency.  NI is separated from GB by The Irish Sea.\n\nOn the same physical island as NI is The Republic of Ireland (also just known as Ireland).

I'm very much working full time.\n\nOther projects? Definitely. I want to use the credibility and goodwill I've built up with my customer base over 23 years to transition to other things. I'm not sure what that will be. I have an open mind. But whatever it is, it has to be something that is beneficial to the environment. And which helps other people. Although $$$$ is important. It won't be about making money. But more a case of the $$$$ following the cause.\n\nI'm here because I'm looking for options. And want to meet like minded men and women.\n\nWhy share my story?\n\nBecause every entrepreneur has been where we've been. Perhaps not flat broke. But close to it.\n\nAnd many give up before they give themselves a chance. And don't have the courage when they're really struggling to stand up to the flak they get from family and friends because they haven't reached 'success' in the time frame determined by other people.\n\nWe've been there.\n\nVictor's parents are a good example. \"How come my son, the architect, is now a purveyor of ironing board covers\"? They couldn't understand that the 'recession we had to have' decimated the building industry. There was no work for architects for 10 years in Australia. And. They were embarrassed at telling their friends that their son made ironing board covers. Instead of designing tall buildings.\n\nThey also couldn't resign themselves to the fact that before the recession we were a very wealthy business couple. With a high profile in the Sydney Australia business community. I was on 3 boards of directors. And Victor was the developers' dream architect.\n\nAnd afterwards. We were flat broke. With no real prospects for earning an income. I'm sure it caused them a great deal of personal pain.\n\nFriends. Perhaps mean well. But were insistent that we get a job. Rather than fiddle around with something so trivial as an ironing board cover. \"Who irons anyway? Doesn't everyone hate it?\"\n\nOur accountant. \"You're not making enough money. You can't start a business in the depths of the worst recession Australia's ever had. Why don't you both just knuckle under and get a real job?\"\n\nAnd then the strangers we meet. \"You really make a living out of selling ironing board covers\"? Well not yet. But we will!\n\nThen there's the disapproval from people because the product isn't sexy. Glamourous. High tech. The fact that people who are serious about ironing think it's the best thing since sliced bread doesn't matter.\n\nThe banks. \"We can't lend you money. Nobody irons. Who are you going to sell to\"? How about the 400,000 men and women in 30 countries? Just as starters.\n\nThe disapproval. And flak. Comes from all directions. And entrepreneurs starting out need to know they have to have a spine of steel to withstand the assault. And once you get over the hump, and realise your dream is possible, life doesn't get easy. But your faith and confidence in yourself increases. You become more focused on where you want to be. And more determined to get there.\n\nOnce you reach that stage, you start to stand up to your dissenters. And put them in their place. Including family.\n\nThat's why I want to share my story. To let entrepreneurs know that anything is possible. You just have to find a way to make it happen. Against all odds.\n\nAppreciate your questions, Marek.

Now you have another customer delighted to have found you.\n\nWalterClick to expand...\n\nG'day Walter @Walter Hay,\n\nThat is one amazing comment! I read it out loud to Victor. We're both ecstatic!!\n\nThank you for taking the time to read all my posts. And my story on my website. You've probably read the equivalent of a book! I find that the most touching of all.\n\nWhere were you born? Close to Mudgee? Kandos? Lithgow? Bathurst?\n\nNext question. If you're looking out your office window at cattle and kangaroos, you're still in Australia. So where? I do see that you say you're a 'Citizen of the World'. So you've obviously spent much of your life travelling to. And/or living in. Other places.\n\n#1. One of the real battles we fought was with website designers. Not listening to us about where our grassroots are. And secondly, not wanting to tweak words when I learned something new from a customer that would make my site better. We were always put on the backburner.\n\nSick of that, a customer told Victor, who is an intuitive designer, but not computer literate, that he could build his own website using FrontPage. Wordpress wasn't even a twinkle in anyone's eye then.\n\nWith the FrontPage manual glued to his eyes, he designed. And built. Our second website. What you see now is his 6th redesign. With each new site, we became bolder with our desire to emphasise the ruralness of our business. And one of Victor's best decisions was to incorporate my photos that I take on the property every morning at sunrise, into the site. Customers and visitors love them.\n\nWe're now on Wordpress. And although Victor designs how the site will look. I'm the backroom gal with the technical expertise that makes it all happen. We sit side by side while we put a site together. We're a perfect team. As always.\n\n#2. It's not hard to provide real value. And real service. All any business owner has to do is have a recollection of how poorly they've been treated at 'XYZ'. Or how bad the product was they purchased. And remember how they never went back. Multiply that by triple digits, and that's how much business a company loses every year because of apathy. But business owners don't seem to relate the poor service. And poor products. To their own business.\n\nAn experience that is riveted in my mind is when Victor and I were waiting to buy fresh pet meat in a shop. A customer came in. Who had been in earlier. His order for cat food hadn't arrived the first time he popped in. It was there the second time. While we were waiting. The owner of the shop, a classy gal with style, put his order together. Apologised for him having to come back twice. And popped an additional two, one kilo packs of cat meat, on top of his order. I will never forget the look of surprise. And delight. On that customer's face.\n\nThis is sooo easy to do. But too many people count the pennies it costs them to keep a customer happy. Rather than the value they've just added to the customer experience.\n\n#3. Searching for a sewing company who employed men and women with a disability was the result of being thrown out of 'able-bodied' sewing companies because we were too fussy about how we wanted our ironing board cover to be made.\n\nIt is the best decision we made. These men and women are loving. And affectionate. Interested in us. And care about us. We're known as 'Mr & Mrs Ironing Board Cover' behind our backs.\n\nHow many workshops can you walk into where the people who sew for you are allowed to down tools? And come over and say hello? None.\n\nThey've sewn millions of items for us. And only one has been returned because of a manufacturing fault.\n\n#4. Mindset. And reputation. Are everything in business.\n\nWith a strong, determined mindset. You can circumnavigate brick walls. Find your way out of dark alleys. Jump hurdles. And get to B. From A.\n\nReputation is everything. And I mean everything. When everything is stripped from you. All you have left is your reputation. It's the baggage you take with you everywhere you go. It's important that a person's reputation be in pristine condition. With no rough edges.\n\nI can't tell you how many times we've been offered money under the table to bend the rules. Especially when Victor was the dream architect loved by developers.\n\nWe instinctively knew to decline the offer.\n\nBecause.\n\nA reputation will either keep a door closed. Or magically open one for you.\n\nBeing in business isn't hard. It's not easy either. But knowing your values. And sticking to them. Makes the road less travelled a better journey.\n\nKeep in touch! You really have added unexpected sparkle to our day.\n\nI will be thrilled if ever I see an order from you. ~Carol\u2764", "Andy Black said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nYes, that info helps thanks.\n\nYou may find a way to deliver into the UK without the tarrif if you investigate further how I'm getting deliveries from the mainland UK into Dublin, via Northern Ireland.\nMaybe you can go the other way?

Because couriers won't deliver to our property. Too off the beaten track. Rylstone Ag Supply graciously offered to accept all courier deliveries there. It's a drive to get there. But it's a good option.\n\nThank you for your kind words. I love people. I'm not a great socialiser. I limit who I spend time with. But I'm very people focussed. And love meeting people on the street. And chit chatting.\n\nBefore the internet. Before shopping centres. And back into the last century. This is how shopkeepers kept their clientele. By liking them. Showing kindness. And consideration.\n\nSome of my earliest memories of going shopping with my mother in New York City before I started school - I'm an expat American - before the age of supermarkets - was the attention the shopkeepers paid to me. I was just a child. But Mrs Novotney, who owned the delicatessen, always cut a slice of salami for me to munch on while she talked to my mother. She was my favourite!\n\nThat was all stripped away when self service became the norm. And shopkeepers got out of the habit of letting their customers know they cared about them. \n\nLove your story about replacing a competitor's product. How many business owners would even think to do that today?\n\nI hope we stay in touch and keep connecting. ~Carol\u2764"], "Page4": ["JustKris said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nThis is such a great thread!

I've noticed that this forum attracts many great people like you.\n\nAlso thanks for making me realise that many succesful people like you listen to Tony Robbins. I should get more into his teachings because I haven't until now. There is a reason he is the most popular self development coach.\n\nWishing you great success and fun in the future.\n\n\nCarol Jones said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nG'day @codonnell ,\n\nThank you for your comment. It's always a delight to meet another Australian.\n\nFirst. We never do anything cheaply. We're selling quality. So our product utilises first-class materials. And when the price goes up, we increase the price of our product. I've never noticed we've lost customers. And this is obviously something you agree with.\n\nI also don't skimp on the essentials for our business. We've had the same suppliers for 23 years. I don't chop and change. Or look for the cheapest price. My loyalty to my suppliers pays off in spades when I need them to move mountains for me in an emergency. As I did recently when the new premier hotel in Tasmania, Macq01, wanted 126 ironing board covers for their boards in a short time frame. So they would be on the boards for opening day.\n\nI willingly pay for quality software that runs my business. Which means I don't have glitches that cost time. And money.\n\nMy accountant is top notch. His advice has been incomparable.\n\nI'm a firm believer that you get what you pay for. And for me. Paying for quality saves time. And money. In the long term.\n\nWe keep our profit margins low. Which discourages anyone who is tempted to copy us. To begin with, the Fitz Like A Glove\u2122 Ironing Board Cover is a pain in the bum to make. Fiddly. With 13 accessories to source.\n\nPeople copy you because they can make your product cheaper. And maker greater profits. In our case, the profit margin just isn't there to make it worth their while.\n\nAlso. We're not me too products. All our products are unique. There is nothing else like them to compare with. And they are all protected by copyright design.\n\nSecond. We've also made many mistakes. But looking back 23 years, I would never again ask. And pay. Experts. For their advice.\n\nWe asked Charles Sturt University's marketing department in Bathurst NSW for advice. Their recommendation? That we be corporate. And edgy. And make our products in China.\n\nThat's not who we are. And is not the image we want to project. We're a rural business. And very much down to earth. And that's the image our customers love.\n\nVictor is Russian. I'm an ex-pat American. Both immigrants to Australia. The last thing we want to do is export jobs to other countries. Our loyalties are to Australia. The best business decision we ever made was to have our products made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability.\n\nEarly on, we sought advice from the Manufacturing Council Of Australia. They appointed us an 'Angel'. As an Australian, you would know who he was. He lied to us. Totally misled us. He was only interested in lining his pockets with the grant the Council gave us. To pay him. He told us 'XYZ' company was very interested in our product. When we rang, we were horrified to hear that they told him they had no interest in our product. And please don't call them again. That happened 7 times in a row. We were shattered.\n\nWe have a litany of bad advice from 'experts'. All revolving around. Sell it cheaper. There is a dearth of 'experts' who know how to sell on quality.\n\nTalk to people in our industry? They all make ironing board covers the same way. We are a breakthrough design. We rang Hills Industries. Who make ironing boards. We sent them a cover. Their marketing manager rang to tell us our cover was the best they had ever seen. We asked them if they would distribute our cover for us. Absolutely not, they said. Their prediction? We'll be lucky to sell 250 covers. Tops. We have more than 400,000 customers in 30 countries.\n\nOur experience is that everyone sells cheaply. Because it's the easy way out.\n\nWe taught ourselves to sell on quality. It's harder. And takes longer to get traction. But we are so experienced at that now, that we don't worry about price. We only put it up when we have to. The last price increase we had was in 2014. By keeping our profit margins low, we discourage competition. And we develop a loyal customer base. Who are aware that they're getting value for money.\n\nThe second best business decision we made was to listen to our customers. They care enough to give us constructive criticism. We have implemented every change they've asked us to make. In running our business. And regarding our website. We have a better. And stronger business. Because of them. They're paying us. And deserve our attention when they make recommendations.\n\nI don't agree that doing things as cheaply as possible is a good business strategy. There's always someone who can be cheaper than you. When you offer superior quality. You're offering value that people don't get elsewhere. And it's hard to compete with that.\n\nMake no mistake, Codonnell, we are very well aware of the fact that we are the ironing board cover of last choice. Customers will always try the cheapest first. But when those cheap covers let them down. Time after time. They finally buy ours. And we have them for life. As one customer told me recently, \"I was always looking for the ultimate cover. And never found it until I purchased yours\". We hear that over. And over.\n\nThis applies to all 7 of our products. Not one of them is the cheapest. But all of them are the best. Ever!\n\nWe always say that our products work. When others don't. And once they buy ours. They know what that means.\n\nOur values are giving the best ever possible to our customers. In terms of products. And customer service. To achieve that, we run our business on high octane fuel.\n\nThose are our values.\n\nWe're all different Codonnell. And we all have different objectives in running our businesses. What's right for me. Could be totally wrong for you.\n\nI hope this answers your questions. It's a pleasure to meet you. And thank you for your questions. They make me think of why we do what we do. Please feel free to ask more questions. ~Carol\u2764Click to expand...\n\nYour mindset on how to do business is very insightful and humane.

Thank you.\n\nI can remember when I was 23 years old. And I would tell you. And everyone else that age. And older.\n\nThat there are two things we need to address.\n\nThe first is that there are no limits to what you can do. Or achieve.\n\nWe put limits on ourselves.

But it does happen. Tony Robbins is an expert at that.\n\nAnd.\n\nThe second thing is to simply take action.\n\nStop thinking. And start doing. Be prepared to make mistakes. Victor and I have made so many mistakes. But we learned from every one of them. And we have a better business because of them.\n\nFailure is NOT making mistakes. Failure is NOT DOING!\n\nSetbacks are part of the process. Victor and I just experienced one this week. While Victor was in a state of despair. I told him that every time we have a setback, we find a better way to do something. And we come out the other side so much better off.\n\nAnd we did. The setback this week. Although crucial.

I am a 28 year old civil engineer graduate, chose this major in college because of parent and school pressure as a result of my good grades at school but untamed and restless as a spirit, I couldn't follow the path everyone in my country followed or expected for me. My mother had joined Amway at some point where I first heard of the \"passive income\" concept, and I was fascinated by this. During my college years I found a guy who was teaching how to make money through Amazon's Kindle pulblishing and said it was newbie friendly, so me, someone with zero experience in Internet marketing or anything whatsover,bought his course and started with it. \n\nAs a deeply spiritual and very sensitive human being though (I am Libra as well, I don't know if the stars or sth have anything to do with anything, I'm just saying lol) I wasn't heart and soul into it because I didn't know my place as a human being in this world. I couldn't find the meaning in pursuing money and financial freedom, since \"we are going to die afterall, what's the point in trying\"? I am not very materialistic either as a person either, thanks to my lucky upbringing as my parents are absolute slowlaners but amazing souls.

Not my spirit, but my brain. My not so easily distracted brain anymore, a skill I strengthened after a loooong and highly discomforting period of time. In a world full of distractions, it requires constant practice and fight and patience. I know it will never stop, every moment I need to fight my urges of instant gratification but I will never give up. Every moment I know become stronger and even when I fall back to old patterns, I stand up again and re-practise, until it is second nature to me.

What you put into it. Sometimes not in equal proportions. \n\nBut if you don't give back - if you can - when the opportunity arises, your soul remains barren.\n\nWhen I look back on my life, I've had help on every journey. Setbacks too. But I remember the people who helped me. \n\nIt starts with my 4th grade teacher, Violet Deitsch. Who gave me confidence. After my 2nd and 3rd grade teachers tried to demolish it. Because I wouldn't be steamrolled by authority. That character trait does not bode well for any child in the school system.\n\nAnd for every person who tried to undermine me in my pursuit to get from A to B. And everyone has them in their life. In spades. I have a memorable person who lifted me up with a helping hand.\n\nI can never repay those people directly.\n\nBut I can pay them the honour of payback by offering others a helping hand.\n\nThat's how life works.\n\nNever. Ever. Have I killed the dreams of another person.  \n\nI've mentored several people. For free. \n\nSome had ambitions which they probably couldn't reach. But I didn't dissuade them from their dream. I just simplified it for them. Drilled down to the core of what they wanted. And helped them change trajectory. While still keeping their dream alive.\n\nLife is negative enough without me adding to it. There's a plethora of negativity in the lives of most people.\n\nBut few people know someone who wants to offer them a helping hand. To let them know that what they want to achieve just might have a chance.\n\nThat's who I am. I'm an optimist. And a realist. I know how easy it is to want to do something.

I've had mothers tell me they use this technique to calm themselves down if they feel inclined to shout at their children. It does break the brain pattern in the head long enough to reflect. And ask. Do I really want to stay in bed? Argue with my family? Do nothing? Rather than do something positive?\n\nI'm so pleased you found value in it.\n\nIt's just after 6am. The sun rises at 6:18am in my rural patch. Every morning at sunrise I go for a walk on my property. With my camera in tow. And post a photo every morning of what I see. On my social media accounts. I'm dressed. Wearing my gumboots. And ready to be surprised by what I see.\n\nMy morning ritual is to write my Morning Pages at 4am. And then go out for my morning walk. Some mornings I don't feel like getting up at 4am. But then I do the countdown. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. And I'm up! It works for me. And I'd never forgive myself if I missed my morning walk.\n\nBest wishes, Chen, for a fabulous Wednesday.

That's a lovely response.\n\nThe business world today is very edgy. And self-focussed. So many entrepreneurs don't want to get to know their customers.

And they want to know how they run their business.\n\nVictor and I are caring people. And when we chose to run our business as a kind, caring company with a heart, we were told by 'experts' we wouldn't last 6 months. Here we are 24 years later. Still in business. With customers who purchased our first Fitz Like A Glove\u2122 Ironing Board Covers. And their extended families.\n\nIf you care about others, you're already in the top 5% of men and women who run a business. Build on that. And find a path that lets this attribute shine through.

Not really the size of a small town. I'm the smallest rural property in my little village. The sheep farms here can be as large as 4,000 hectares, or 10,000 acres.\n\nBig cattle stations up north and west are larger than most small towns. The largest working cattle station in the world is in South Australia. It's Anna Creek Station. Is 1,977,000 acres. 8,000 square kilometres. Larger than Israel. And is more than twice the size of King Ranch in Texas. Which is the biggest ranch in America. Which is 825,000 acres. Or 3,340 square kilometres.\n\nThis is the story about the property.\n\nWhen we lost everything. And I mean everything. We had no money. Our only source of income was the remnants or two architectural jobs that Victor needed to finish.  We had to leave Sydney Australia because we couldn't afford to live there. And try to find someplace affordable in the bush.\n\nA friend told us about this area. Not because it was beautiful. Which it is. Jaw dropping beautiful. But because it was devastated by a 9-year drought. No one wants to live on barren land. We found a farmer who was trying to sell his property, but couldn't. He agreed to rent it to us at a rock bottom price. Low enough that even we could afford it.\n\nThe property was still for sale while we were renting it. And he never had any takers.\n\nAfter renting it for 3 years, he was more desperate to sell. He offered to sell it to us at again, a rock bottom price. We told him no bank would give us a loan. He said that wasn't a problem. He would finance us. And that's how we got to afford to buy this property.\n\nWe removed the sheep. Let the native vegetation regrow. Trees self-seeded. And grew like topsy. Today, we have more than 120 species of birds that fly in. And fly out. Of our property. There are many more birds that I can hear. But can't identify because they never leave the safety of the leafy tree canopy.\n\nKangaroos roam free from the threat of human predators. Wild goats pay us visits. We see the occasional wombat. Lizards. Snakes. Frogs. And we now have our neighbour agist his sheep at intervals to keep the paddock grass low to avoid bushfires.\n\nWe created a hectare (2.5 acres) of garden in the paddock that encloses the farmhouse. 110 trees surround our house. 200+ fragrant climbing roses ramble along the fence line. Kilometres of fragrant honeysuckle is trained to grow along the roof line of our house. And we planted thousands of fragrant shrubs as understory and habitat for small wildlife.\n\nToday, it's worth 7 times what we paid for it. And is a rural showpiece.\n\nSerendipity is an important part of life. Some of the best things happen when we don't plan them.\n\nThank you for asking @MTF . If ever I can help you, please let me know. ~Carol\u2764", "Nigel B said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nAustralia is about 770 million hectares - US is 940 million.\n320 million people in the US, only 24 million in Australia. \n\nSafe to say that with more than ten times as much land per capita, the land prices are going to be very much more affordable, especially in rural areas. \n\nThat's only about 135 acres, which sounds large but would be a really small holding by any ag. standards in the US or Australia ...Click to expand...\n\nG'day @Nigel B from Oz,\n\nYou're absolutely right. The cost of rural land depends on the location. In lush dairy country, it's very expensive. But in my region, where we live on the side of a mountain. And our land is literally a rock shelf, so is hard to till. It's much cheaper. And affordable. Superfine sheep thrive here. But cattle don't. It's hard for them to put on weight. Because there just isn't enough nutrients in the paddock grass. And no one in my village grows crops. As the Department of Primary Industry told me when I enquired in 1995 about planting a garden, \"you do know that no one at Ilford has a garden\". They do now!\n\nUp north. And west. Where the land is very dry and arid. One cow needs at least 100 acres to thrive. The land there is cheap. And this is where the large cattle stations are. Our largest cattle station is Anna Creek Station. Which is 1,977,000 acres. Which is also the largest cattle station in the world. In drought conditions, it only carries 1,500 head of cattle.

We know that whatever happens, we have each other's back. Both personally. And professionally.\n\nThis is because we share common values about family. And business. And we also share the knowledge that we're better as a team act. Rather than a solo act.\n\nBecause. We respect and admire each other's talents. Neither one of us is good at something that the other is brilliant at. So we never compete with each other. Which is one reason professional couples break up. Jealousy. And stepping on each other's toes. \n\nLiving and working together 24/7/365 for 35 of our 41 years, means we've also shared more ups and downs together than most couples. Those are also the ties that bind.\n\nI admire anyone who has the wherewithal to tangle with the 'me too' products on eBay and Amazon. And the 'sell at the cheapest price mentality'. I'm not cut from that cloth. I was pleased to read on your thread that you price your products higher. And get sales. That's truly amazing. It shows what tremendous skills you have in marketing your products.\n\nAre you on target to retire in your 30's. As planned?\n\nIt's been a delight to get to know you better. And I hope we keep in touch. Best wishes for finding just the right location to live in Queensland. ~Carol\u2764", "Carol Jones said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nAre you on target to retire in your 30's.

We have a few new projects that we're working on that may bring retirement closer.. but I have to admit I've lost a lot of focus since having a baby. I hope to get back on track soon. \n\n\n\nCarol Jones said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nI admire anyone who has the wherewithal to tangle with the 'me too' products on eBay and Amazon.Click to expand...\n\nWe actually started selling products that are unique to our brands (we have a number of different brands, each with products from different niches) - we differentiate through design and use premium quality materials in our products. I, too, don't like to cut corners when it comes to quality. I also don't like the idea of 'racing to the bottom' when it comes to price and competing with our competitors. The only way we can differentiate ourselves (and charge a premium) is through quality and design. We have a lot of loyal customers who have happily written great reviews for us which helps a lot too. \n\nI think you could potentially also benefit from opening your sales channel up to Amazon (USA, Europe, Canada). You would simply leverage their fulfillment and distribution network whilst maintaining the integrity of your brand (via managing the seller account yourself, or appointing just one authorized distributor). You'd have to crunch the numbers re the logistics of it all (being in a rural town will impact transport costs to the Amazon warehouse) etc. Anyway, if you are interested in going down this route, just shoot me a message and I'd be happy to help out however I can.", "Kerin said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nI think you could potentially also benefit from opening your sales channel up to Amazon (USA, Europe, Canada).Click to expand...\n\nThank you @Kerin.\n\nI would never deal with Amazon. I don't share their values. I care about how people who work for a company are treated. And Amazon has the same reputation as Apple under Steve Jobs. They burn people up. And treat them poorly. And there is nothing about Jeff Bezos personally that I admire. \n\nThis is also why I don't have my products in retail outlets. Retailers are more interested in their bottom line. Than they are in the people who help them earn that bottom line.\n\nIt's harder to do what I'm doing. But the warm relationship I have with my customers is so rewarding. I just love the feedback. My Fitz Like A Glove\u2122 Ironing Board Cover is going to travel the world as the ironing board cover of choice on an $8 million yacht that hosts  8 guests at a time as it cruises Australia and New Zealand. The owner placed the order yesterday. And told me how excited the crew is knowing it will be ironing on the best cover in the world.\n\nButlers and housekeepers in BIG houses in Australia buy my cover. And we've formed very warm friendships. Butlers are amongst my biggest referrals.\n\nI also count celebrities. And members of the BRW Rich List amongst my customers. They're not looking for me on Amazon.\n\nEarlier this year we covered all the boards at the new prestige MacQ01 hotel in Hobart, Tasmania. The hotel group which manages the hotel chose us, even though we were the most expensive cover. Because of our quality. And they love that it's made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability. After they received their order, they asked me to thank the men and women who make the cover. And to tell them how much their dedication to quality is appreciated.\n\nWe all have reasons as to who we choose to do business with. And why. I choose not to travel the route of businesses who have no vested interest in me personally.\n\nI'm alone in this viewpoint, Kerin. My friends think I've got a screw missing. I don't. I instinctively know not to build a business on rented land. Where the rules change at the whim of the landlord. Which is why I don't cultivate Facebook. Amazon. Or any other platform like them.\n\nI'm interested in long-term loyal customers. Who aren't distracted by what else they see when looking at my product range. Which is why I spend my time cultivating them on my land. But. Again. It's a harder road to travel.\n\nI don't have children. But have many friends who do. It's natural to be distracted by your child. They need to be nurtured. And focussed on. That's what makes them. And you. Happy. And confident. You'll know when it's time to reignite your fire for your business.\n\nPlease keep me in the loop. ~Carol\u2764", "What a story!  Thanks for sharing, Carol.\n\nI hugely admire and respect your business practices:  insisting on top quality.  Treating customers with utmost respect and personal attention.  Hiring disabled workers.  Always practicing scrupulous honesty.  Those practices may not produce a quick buck, but you're living proof they can produce a strong, thriving, and long-lived business.\n\nI'm very impressed that so much of your business comes from referrals from your ardent admirers.  It's clear that your customers adore you and your products.  (And it's clear you adore your customers, too!)\n\nI'm just astonished that so many people feel the need to invest in a premium ironing board cover!  I've been ironing my own shirts for almost 40 years.  Not every day, but often enough, at home and at many dozens of hotels while on business trips.  And I don't really recall ever running into an ironing board cover that worked so badly that I wanted to invest $150 or more in a Rolls Royce cover.  Some of them weren't ideal, but it wasn't enough of an issue to be a problem.  And I've been using my cover at home for 27 years -- no sign of wearing out yet.  Obviously not everyone is like me, but even though I'm a prime member of your target audience, I never would have guessed that a market existed for your product!!  I guess the immediate response you got -- immediate referrals from Victor's mother & from her friends -- showed you otherwise.\n\nYou are so fortunate to have such a perfect life partner to share your journey.  I thought I did too, but after some friction (especially over my choice of entrepreneurial pursuits, even though we had both left our jobs to start our own business), my wife left me after 20 years.  That was over 6 years ago, and I still miss my best buddy and partner-in-crime.  Blessings to you and Victor.", "Good morning @garyfritz from Oz,\n\nThank you! I'm delighted you've read my story on The Fastlane Forum. It's almost getting to be the size of a small paperback novel!\n\n\n\ngaryfritz said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nI hugely admire and respect your business practices:Click to expand...\n\nI've been working since I was 13 years old. Have never been without a job since then. I worked in a department store on Saturdays until I went to university. Did babysitting gigs. Worked my way through university. And have been working continuously ever since. For large companies. George Washington University in America. Small companies. My own businesses since 1983. And have acquired two more degrees since then.\n\nI'm a master voyeur. And an intrepid eavesdropper. And it never ceases to amaze me how much I learn how to live life just from observing. And listening.\n\nI am fully aware of how people talk about other people behind their backs. And I know exactly what I want people to say about me behind my back. Whatever that is. I have to walk the talk.\n\nMy first. And biggest takeaway. Is that your reputation is your baggage. And it travels with you everywhere.\n\nMy first job after uni was working at George Washington University. Although I now live in Australia. I was born in New York City. So I'm an expat American.\n\nStan was an MBA student. And sleazy. He couldn't be trusted.\n\nA very important document went missing from the Dean's office in the School Of Business Administration. Which is where I worked. Just the three of us. The Dean. His trusted PA of 25 years. And me.\n\nWe had all seen Stan looking at the document. And it was assumed that Stan had taken it.\n\nHe hadn't. Another professor had taken it. And not let the Dean know he had it.\n\nThe Dean and his PA were full of remorse for accusing Stan. I wasn't. My logic was then. And still remains today. That if Stan was trustworthy. He would never have been considered as the villain.\n\nI apply that logic to everything I do. My reputation is my baggage. And that baggage must always be a perfect package. And in pristine condition. Because it travels with me everywhere.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing that could tempt me to tarnish that reputation.\n\nI've turned down under the table offers that would benefit me financially. Refused to betray people to further my career. Or ingratiate me with someone more powerful. I've refused to sell my products to customers who I don't think will gain any benefit from using them.\n\nI'm a firm believer that people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. And if I expect people in business to act honourably, then I must be an example of one who does.\n\nIt's a simple philosophy. But it works for me. Whatever others think I may have sacrificed to maintain my reputation wasn't worth having in the first place.\n\n\n\ngaryfritz said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nI'm just astonished that so many people feel the need to invest in a premium ironing board cover!Click to expand...\n\nWe're all different. And have different needs. I have over 400,000 customers in 30 countries. So there are enough people in the marketplace who will pay for superior quality to keep me in business.\n\n\n\ngaryfritz said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nYou are so fortunate to have such a perfect life partner to share your journey.Click to expand...\n\nThat makes me laugh, Gary. Victor and I aren't married. But have been together for 41 years. And have lived and worked together 24/7/365 for the last 35 of those years.\n\nWe disagree about many things. And disagree about how to do things. We spit. And we spat. I'm very fiery. Victor's very calm.\n\nBut we share the same values regarding family. Relationships. And how to run a business. Those are the ties that bind. We are joined at the hip. And in a time of crisis, we are a formidable duo. We always have each others back. And support. We also recognise that we are stronger as a team. Rather than as a solo act.\n\nThose qualities do make for a perfect partner. They're hard to find.\n\n\n\ngaryfritz said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nI still miss my best buddy and partner-in-crime.Click to expand...\n\nI'm so sad that you no longer have your 'best buddy and partner in crime' to share your life with. As we get older, sharing the journey becomes more important.\n\nWhen I left America. On a lark. To dabble in the Australian lifestyle. The first thing that hit me hard was that I had no past that I could share with my new friends. We couldn't reminisce about things we had done together. The best I could do was create a new past that I would eventually be able to share with them.\n\nWhich I have done. My two oldest friends in Australia are the first two gals I met. And we are still firm friends. I also keep in touch with their children. Who I knew before they were born. And watched them grow up. I was their Auntie Mame. Taking them to places their parents disapproved of. So I have a lively past with those boys. That we reminisce about. Who now have wives and children of their own.\n\nI keep in touch via Skype with a high school friend in America. And although he and I can reminisce about our high school days. We can't reminisce any further ahead than that.\n\nAnd I have no one to share my wicked childhood in New York City with. I was the child from hell. Ask any one of my mother's friends. Independent. Can't be told anything. Couldn't stay out of mischief. My father was forever asking my mother if she was sure she brought the right baby home from the hospital.\n\nBut I did reform. Somewhat. Maturity caught up with me. And rounded out the sharp edges. While leaving the basic core intact.\n\nI hope you find a gal who will travel with you along your Yellow Brick Road. It makes the journey much more interesting. Meaningful. And exciting.\n\nIt's a pleasure to meet you, Gary. Thank you for dropping in.

And our personal possessions. To pay off what debt we could. And made a scheme of arrangement with our creditors to pay off the remaining debt.\n\nPoor as church mice. We left the city lights of Sydney Australia. For a rural life in a remote village with no internet access. No email. Not even call waiting. But it met our most important criteria. We could live in a farmhouse whose rent we could afford to pay. The village was heavily affected by a severe drought. And the house was not a desirable place to live. But it was our safety net.\n\nWe made a decision to find our way back by utilising simple solutions. Our skills were in design. And research. So we reinvented ourselves as designers and makers of textile products. Our first product didn't capture the hearts of the marketplace. But our second product did. We redesigned the humble ironing board cover utilising a low tech solution to make sure it was firmly anchored to an ironing board. So it never moved.

Is there any advice you can offer to improve this skill?Click to expand...\n\nG'day @MTF from Oz,\n\nThe answer is yes. I have always been a caring, warm person. It's my signature trait.\n\nBut.\n\nI'm not caring and warm to everyone.\n\nI can't abide rudeness. Bad manners. Abysmal customer service. Deceit. Disloyalty. People hurling verbal abuse. And violence towards children.\n\nAnd I will quickly change from Dr Jekyll into Mr Hyde. I take a stand. And I have been known to reduce grown men to tears. \n\nI'm not one to turn a blind eye. My partner often wishes I was!\n\n99.9% of the time. What you read here is who I am.\n\nIf we don't care about other people, we leave the world poorer for not helping.\n\nI'm where I am today because other people helped me. I can never repay them. Nor would they expect me to.\n\nBut I can pay it forward. \n\nI know what it's like to wander aimlessly in dark tunnels. Not seeing the light. Not knowing what to do next in my business. I often had to figure it out for myself. Because not many people in business do what I do.\n\nI'm here because I want to share my experience. And help other people make their journey less haphazard.\n\nIf this skill doesn't come naturally to you. You can easily develop it.\n\nBe outward focussed. Instead of inward focussed.\n\nWe all have memories of feeling awkward or isolated from other people. Remember what it's like to be in that situation. And make sure you reach out to someone who's feeling that way right now. And ask if you can help them. It's like a shot of adrenalin when you do that.\n\nA story.\n\nWhen I was a high flying businesswoman in Sydney Australia. Before we escaped to the bush. I joined The Institute of Directors.\n\nI was not only a director of my own company. But on the Board of Directors for The American Chamber Of Commerce in Australia. On the Board of Directors for The Pan Pacific Direct Marketing Symposium. The largest direct marketing conference in the southern hemisphere. And on the Board of Directors for The Restaurant And Catering Association.\n\nI was eminently qualified to be a member of that organisation.\n\nI went to their first luncheon. By myself. Which I usually do. I was there to meet people. Not to stay glued to someone else.\n\nI pushed open the huge doors to the dining room.\n\nAnd was met with a wall of suits. A formidable wall of suits. Many of these men standing shoulder to shoulder in a circle. With no room for someone else to squeeze in.\n\nI am literally 5'2\". With eyes of blue. And was dwarfed by these men.\n\nTeetering on my stilettos, I quickly grasped that I was the only woman there.\n\nI took a deep breath. Accepted a glass of mineral water from the waiter. And started to circle the room. Pretending I was looking for someone.\n\nWhich I was. I was looking for someone standing alone. Looking lost.\n\nI found him. I walked up. Introduced myself. Asked him his name. What he does. Where he works. And we started a conversation. \n\nWe sat at lunch together. On the way out, he confessed this was his first luncheon. He knew no one. And was so grateful to have someone ~ !with experience! ~ come up and say hello.\n\nIt doesn't take much to add a bit of razzle-dazzle into the life of another person. You just need to let them know you care. About them.\n\nI hope this answers your question @MTF. ~Carol\u2764", "Deliafiori said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nDear Carol your story is just amazing,\nI have a small winary in Sardina and my dream is to sell the wine on line only!\nI am living in london and I am finding very dificult the sell process here, I have to be honest I dislike selling into restaurant becouse they want to kill my price and don t see too much value on the product!

But certainly, my partner and I started this business at an age when most people wouldn't be thinking of reinventing themselves.\n\nWhen we started in 1994, the word entrepreneur wasn't a description used to describe a person starting a small business. The word was reserved for a higher echelon of business types. Elon Musk comes to mind. Richard Branson.\n\nToday, anyone who isn't working in a corporate environment is an entrepreneur.\n\nThe answer to your question is YES! There are many people who didn't get it together until later in life. Who are running very successful businesses.\n\nEveryone has baggage. Including teenagers. And some people never get it together. And drift from A to B to C.\n\nEvidence is that the older you are when you start a business, the better your odds are of lasting the distance.\n\nYou're not as impatient. You already know that 'Business Is A Tough Gig'. You're more committed to the end result. You have wisdom. And a greater experience of life.\n\nAll that being said, there are three words that apply to everybody who starts a business.\n\nCommitment. You must be committed to seeing it through. Regardless of how crushing it can be at times. And it can be extremely crushing. And disappointing. There are so many times when you run into a headwind. The sails fall off the mast. The boat is taking on water. And the temptation to quit and throw in the towel is just too easy to do.\n\nOne of LinkedIn's most successful Virtual Assistant recently did a post about why she's so successful. And it's simple. She said she gave herself no option to call it quits. It had to work. There was no escape hatch.\n\nDiscipline. Dan Kennedy said it best. \"Self discipline is the magic power that makes you virtually unstoppable.\"\n\nThat means you do things even if you don't feel like doing them. Or aren't motivated to do them. Or you just prefer to procrastinate.\n\nAs with everything in life. We are all where we are today because of how much. Or how little. We do.\n\nConsistency. Do something every day to get you from A to B.\n\nI'm a lover of Microsoft's OneNote. My whole business and personal life is in that notebook.\n\nMy plans. My ideas. My goals. My ambition. My To Do's.\n\nI keep it open on my desktop all the time so I can key in thoughts as they come into my head during the day.\n\nI use that information to, on Sunday afternoon, make a weekly list of everything I need to do. I break it down into daily activities.\n\nSocial media.\n\nBlog posts.\n\nWebsite.\n\nTarget markets.\n\nOnline orders.\n\nI have developed the habit of doing these things on a consistent basis. Not when I feel like doing it. But consistently. Every day.\n\nI wouldn't be where I am today if I did things only when I felt like it.\n\nExamples of late in life successful entrepreneurs.\n\nThese three are from Australia.\n\nA lawyer who is 76. Who couldn't bear another day of conflict in divorce cases.\n\nShe quit her law firm when she was 70. And started her own law firm. Handling only those divorces cases that are amicable. With no conflict regarding property. Or children. Her clients love this approach. Appreciate her fixed fee. And word of mouth is making her very successful.\n\nA gentleman who is 79 started a business at age 72 placing older men and women in employment.\n\nHe's even providing older workers to Australian banks. In their customer service area. The banks have discovered that these people have wisdom and experience of life that enables them to empathise with customers better. And their level of customer complaints has dropped.\n\nHe's now expanding into placing men and women who have a disability into gainful employment.\n\nA prominent woman in the wellness industry started her business at age 67. And hasn't looked back. She also has 4 employees. None of which are under the age of 65.\n\nI'm sure none of these men and women found it easy. But they gave themselves no option but to make their businesses work.\n\nYou can be anything you want to be, Dave. So long as you're committed to doing the hard yards to get from A to B. Older age is no barrier to success. But laziness is!\n\nPeople agonise too much today over their purpose in life. And their why.\n\nThe self help industry has perpetuated the myth that your 'purpose in life' and your 'why' are important to leading a meaningful life.\n\nNobody asked those questions 25 years ago. Most people just got on with life.\n\nAs we did.\n\nWe crashed. We got up. Looked around for something else to do. And did it.\n\nWe weren't paralysed into inaction by deciding we should now discover our 'purpose in life'. And our 'why'.\n\nAnd back then, it never occurred to anyone to 'do what they love'.\n\nBernadette Jiwa, the Australian international best selling business author, included our story in her latest book 'Hunch'. I'm the Ironing Whisperer. On page 73.\n\nWhen she asked me what made us start a business selling ironing board covers, I laughed.\n\nI told her no one in their right mind would choose ironing board covers as the product most likely to be successful.\n\nMy partner, who is an architect, designed this cover for his mother as a gift. To help her with her ironing when she was recovering from a stroke. It was never meant to be a business.\n\nBut it turned into an accidental one.\n\nWhy did we proceed with it?\n\nBecause we were flat broke. No other source of income presented itself. People were throwing money at us to have an ironing board cover that didn't move on their board. We would have been irresponsible not to have run with it. And make something of it.\n\nDid we love it? No. We didn't. We had aspirations to do something more glamourous. More awe inspiring.\n\nBut this business gave Victor the opportunity to design new products.\n\nAnd gave me the opportunity to do something I excel at. Customer service. Letting customers know I love them because they chose me above all other companies. And they responded in kind.\n\nDo I love my business today? Absolutely! I wouldn't trade the last 24 years for anything.\n\nWe dragged the prevailing image of the ironing board cover out of the cheap, trashy, supermarket bin. And elevated ours into a must-have product if you crave quality.\n\nWe created romance around our business by emphasising our remote location in rural Australia. By using photographs of our beautiful rural property on our website. In our email newsletters. And in our printed literature. And by writing about our rural lifestyle in blog posts. We discovered that our lifestyle is now the envy of our customers. And our friends.\n\nAnd by choosing to have our products made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability, we set ourselves apart from everyone else.\n\nIn the beginning, we had no strategy. And none of what we did had anything to do with a 'purpose in life'. Or a 'why'. Or 'do what I love'. It had everything to do with earning $$$$ to put food on the table.\n\nThis business is now part of 'my purpose in life'. It's a part of 'why' I love my life. And it allows me to 'do what I love to do'. Which is to give back to other people.\n\nI hope this helps you. And inspires you! ~Carol\u2764\n\nPS.

Told us that the bank would issue a no questions asked credit card for a maximum of $500. Per person.\n\nWe were able to get 2 credit cards with a $500 limit. So we had a slush fund of $1,000 to work with. Which was a fortune to us.\n\nAll our orders were word of mouth. And cash up front. There was no Amazon Prime. Or eBay. That delivered the next day. Everything was mailorder. And people were prepared to wait 30 days to receive their order.\n\nWe would wait until the end of the month to see how many orders we had. And order enough fabric and accessories to fill those orders. So most of what we did came out of cash flow. We had no accounts. So these purchases were cash payments up front for us.\n\nFace to face events and stocking up for them beforehand came out of the credit cards. Which we paid off at the end of every month.\n\nOur marketing consisted of modest events. Which were mainly agricultural shows. And markets. That cost $10. To a maximum of $50. To attend.\n\nWe would leave our farmhouse at 2am to arrive at our destination by 6am. And arrive back at the farmhouse between midnight. And 2am. They were gruelling days.\n\nWe also did letterbox drops. We could do letterbox drops for 3 cents per letter. We produced the leaflets on my computer. And printed them off on our photocopier.\n\nWhen we sold our possessions to pay off debt. We kept some things. My computer. Which was a bulky, boxy, CRT computer with a black screen and green lettering. No graphics. And our photocopier.\n\nVictor, being an architect, was also a very good sketch artist. So our graphics consisted of his pencil sketches of the products.\n\nWe distributed the leaflets to rural areas only. Where rural women were still heavily into ironing. And were used to buying items mailorder. Also, it was rare to see a 'No Junk Mail' sticker on their rural mailboxes.\n\nWe did very well with those leaflets. And were able to build up a strong word of mouth business.\n\nWe led a frugal life.\n\nWe only bought what we needed in the supermarket. No luxuries. No meat. We couldn't afford it. No chocolates.\n\nWe had a vegetable garden. And ate what we could grow.\n\nWe couldn't afford beer. Or wine. Or spirits. Neither of us smoke. We never so much as bought a cup of coffee in a cafe.\n\nWe didn't accept social invitations because we couldn't afford to bring a bottle of wine. Nor could we afford to reciprocate.\n\nThose were hard times. But we had a goal. Which was to get out of debt. And we were prepared to make whatever sacrifices were required to reach that goal.\n\nRegarding copy. All the copy was written by us. I know nothing about those books you mentioned. Or special words.\n\nWe just told our story. And described the products in great detail. And offered everyone a no questions asked money back guarantee if they weren't happy. And a twelve-month wear and tear guarantee. Meaning. We guaranteed that whatever they purchased, they couldn't wear it out in twelve months.\n\nNo one else did that at the time. We were a first. And that gave customers confidence when buying from us.\n\nWe included a black and white brochure, produced on our photocopier, to customers with every order. Including a handwritten thank you note. And mailed to them once a year with another black and white photocopied brochure. Telling them how much we loved them for choosing us over other companies.\n\nThat's how we built this business from nothing. To something. Purely on trust. And a willingness to have a special relationship with people who care enough to buy from us.\n\nThe only special words we use are . . . love . . . thank you . . . we hope you like what you've purchased.\n\nAnd that's how we continue to build this business. By developing trustful, deeply personal relationships with our customers.\n\nWe don't need anything else.\n\nI hope this answers your questions.

I must say you really have what the book Unscripted refers to as a productocracy where the product itself pulls in customers like a black hole, without needing much for funnels and gimmicks. All the best! Click to expand...\n\nG'day again @Xeon,\n\nThank you! Appreciated.\n\nI do have a productocracy. And I'm aware of it. And admit to not knowing about the term until I read Unscripted.\n\nThis is the reason why.\n\nMy products are utilitarian. Each one solves a problem.\n\nPeople don't come to my website. Or order from me over the phone. For any reason other than they're looking for a solution to a problem they can't find elsewhere.\n\nAnd when they discover my products work. When others don't. They become very loyal customers. Because that in itself fills a need. Products that don't disappoint.\n\nThe fact that my products aren't sexy. Or trendy. But low tech. Rather than high tech. Works in my favour. I'm not a fad. But I'm very much a staple.\n\nAfter 24 years, I'm now receiving calls from customers worried that I've retired and they wouldn't be able to order. And after being relieved we're still in business, they tell me before they hang up that they're worried I'll retire before the product they're now purchasing wears out.\n\nIt's a compliment.\n\nThis loyalty has much to do with the quality of what we offer.\n\nBut it also has much to do with the love and attention we give to our customers. They come back because they remember how warm and welcoming we are every time they order. That's an intangible that can't be measured. But when someone tells me they still have my note that came with their parcel a few years ago, it's not hard to realise that these intangibles are what makes us memorable.\n\nForget the gimmicks. And the tricky words. Offer products that solve a genuine problem. Then talk to your customers from the heart. It's a sure-fire winner. ~Carol\u2764", "JasonR said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nThank you for sharing. It\u2019s people like you who share their stories that make me come back here.

And very much appreciated! ~Carol\u2764", "Carol Jones said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nGood morning from rural Australia,\n\nIn a nutshell, my partner and I design and make textile products that are simple solutions for difficult problems. We have 400,000 customers in 30 countries around the world who think our products are the best thing since sliced bread. The icing on the cake is that all our products are made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability. We are renown for our simple solutions that work. When others don't.\n\nThat's the event.\n\nThe process is this.\n\nIn 1992, my partner and I lost everything in Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating's 'recession we had to have'. We closed down two businesses. My partner's 12 year old architectural practice. My market research consultancy. We farewelled 16 loyal and supportive staff. We sold our home of 22 years. Two cars. And our personal possessions. To pay off what debt we could. And made a scheme of arrangement with our creditors to pay off the remaining debt.\n\nPoor as church mice. We left the city lights of Sydney Australia. For a rural life in a remote village with no internet access. No email. Not even call waiting. But it met our most important criteria. We could live in a farmhouse whose rent we could afford to pay. The village was heavily affected by a severe drought. And the house was not a desirable place to live. But it was our safety net.\n\nWe made a decision to find our way back by utilising simple solutions. Our skills were in design. And research. So we reinvented ourselves as designers and makers of textile products. Our first product didn't capture the hearts of the marketplace. But our second product did. We redesigned the humble ironing board cover utilising a low tech solution to make sure it was firmly anchored to an ironing board. So it never moved. Which is what makes people hate ironing.\n\nIf you make one good product. Customers want more. So we designed 6 more textile products. And today we have more than 400,000 customers in 30 countries. Without any retail distribution. And all done online today. But in the beginning, it was all mail order.\n\nWe've been down dark alleys. Wondered if we were certifiably mad to keep doing what we were doing when ironing board covers are not top of mind with most people.\n\nBut we discovered they are very top of mind with men and women who must iron.\n\nEven though the subject is not sexy, our products, and our story, have been written about in every major publication in Australia.\n\nWe've been featured on mainstream TV. Interviewed on radio. Included in two books. The latest being 'Hunch' by international best selling author Bernadette Jiwa. I'm the 'Ironing Whisperer' on page 73.\n\nThe process of working every day is what got us to where we are today.\n\nWe did what everyone said we couldn't do. We built a worldwide business from broke. On a remote rural property. Before the internet and email came to our rural village.\n\nI'm here to mix with like minded men and women. I have 35 years of business experience to share. I've done the hard yards. And would love to be of help to those of you who can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAnd. I want to travel further along the road to wealth.\n\nIt will be a pleasure to meet you. ~Carol\u2764Click to expand...\n\n\nHi @Carol Jones ,\n\nMy husband suggested that I read this post, and I have to say... I am blown away. I am new to the forum, so I am still snooping around trying to find people who I can relate to/whose stories I can learn from, and you are a great inspiration!\n\nIn short, my husband and I are starting a business in performance-enhancing altheticwear and, like you and your partner, we are trying to be wise with our budgeting decisions. That said, I have a few basic questions for you:\n\n1. Why did you start off with mail-orders only? \n2. When and how did you know that it was time to call it quits on the first product? \n3. How did you spread the word about your product in the early days?\n\n(I apologize if some of these were answered in previous comments. I am trying my best to read everything while at my 9 - 5 in my lovely cubicle... gag).  \n\nThank you!\nKristin", "Good morning @Kristin R from Oz,\n\nA big thank you to you and your husband for taking the time to read such a long thread!

How did you spread the word about your product in the early days?Click to expand...\n\nI'll answer question #2 first. Because that relates to my answer to question #1. And then question #3. Because that also relates to question #1.\n\n2. When and how did you know that it was time to call it quits on the first product?\n\nMy partner, Victor Pleshev, is an architect. Although the building industry was demolished in 'the recession we had to have'. He still had a strong desire to design.\n\nSo we turned to product design.\n\nWe knew nothing about product design. Which is why we chose to improve already existing products with his simple design solutions.\n\nOur first product was a dog collar. Called 'Dashing Dogs'.\n\nWe noticed that all the dog collars on the market were heavy. And stiff. And cut into the neck of one of our dogs. Who had short hair. A cheeky and gorgeous Dalmatian. Rescued by us after being dumped in our rural patch.\n\nBecause Victor understands strength. And tension. He designed a collar made of soft leather. Where two pieces of leather are crossed over each other at certain points. The crossover reinforced with a rivet. To make a whole collar. It was not only very strong. But very elegant.\n\nThis was 1993. Shortly after we left Sydney and moved to the rural property we were renting.\n\nWe sourced the leather ourselves in Sydney. From a tannery on Botany Bay. Tanneries are a very dirty, highly poisonous place to work. And pollute the waterways on which they're located.\n\nBut it was still legal to operate a tannery in Australia then. \n\nWe had the leather tanned to our specifications and cut by laser to Victor's design. \n\nAnd the leather pieces were then given to a company who braided them together into the collars. This company was run by an old-style business gentleman. Who was 78. The writing was on the wall that he wouldn't be in business in the long term.\n\nVictor and I come from the service industry. Architecture. And me from the market research industry.\n\nWe knew absolutely NOTHING about getting products into the marketplace. We were the blind. Leading the blind.\n\nWe focussed on retailers. Who. We discovered. Were monumentally uninterested in these collars.\n\nThe pitifully few retailers who did stock them, had them ridiculed at the time, by the leader in dog collars in the pet industry. Their representatives, upon seeing the collars on the collar rack, telling the retailers they were not only too expensive, but were inferior quality dog collars. That would break in an instant. And beloved dogs who strain at the collars would be breaking free and running into traffic. Getting killed. \n\nThey really whipped up the horror stories. \n\nAll but one retailer returned stock. And asked to be reimbursed. The problem was, we had already spent the revenue we earned from those sales. And had no money to reimburse these retailers. So we told them, on advice from our solicitor, who was also a family friend, that as we hadn't signed any agreement regarding 'sale or return', we weren't legally obligated to reimburse them. And returned the collars to them. COD postage.\n\nThere was a glimmer of hope with veterinary practices. Which were just starting to sell pet accessories. Vets could see how good these collars were. And placed orders. And reorders.\n\nDistributors to veterinary practices weren't interested in our product. So we had to contact vets ourselves. Which was very slow.\n\nAnd.\n\nFinancially. We couldn't service them. \n\nTo secure orders, we had to send a free sample to every veterinary surgery. When we calculated how much this would cost. And what our expected return would be, we couldn't see how we could afford to do this without borrowing. And we couldn't borrow to develop this business.\n\nOn the plus side, pet shops paid on delivery of product. Long before we had to pay the tannery. The laser cutter. And the collar maker. \n\nVeterinary practices paid in 60 days. So we were always owing money to our suppliers before we got paid. With nothing left over to develop the business.\n\nSo we called it a day. Which was always going to be on the cards anyway. \n\nShortly afterwards, Our tannery was forced to close down because of air and water pollution problems. They rang us wanting to know if we would like to buy their leather at a factory closing down sale.\n\nAnd our maker of collars died. And no one was interested in continuing his business.\n\nHow strong were these collars? Our Dalmatian was still wearing his when he died 11 years later.\n\n3. How did you spread the word about your product in the early days?\n\nAfter our experience with retailers, we concluded they know little. Or nothing. About the products they sell. And are rarely interested in selling something that's different because 'me too' products, that require no explanation, are much easier to sell. \n\nAnd. To be honest. They weren't a group of people we could develop a personal relationship with. \n\nThey were mainly interested in how much money they could make from each supplier. They weren't really interested in us. Or in most of their suppliers. And would cut short most telephone conversations. There was nothing in it for them to develop a personal relationship.\n\nWe had no money for advertising, so we hit the road. Spruiking about our products anywhere we could set up a microphone. We demonstrated why our Fitz Like A Glove\u2122 Ironing Board Cover was different to everything else on the market. And told our story loud enough for passers-by to hear. Who rewarded us by buying our products.\n\nI had never spruiked before. Was horrified at the thought. But an experienced gal in the agricultural show business stopped at our stall. Showed me how to do it. Convinced me sales would soar if I got the attention of passersby. And on my first spruik, I scored a sale of 3 covers from a passerby! I was hooked. And never looked back.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2008, we travelled at least 60,000kms per year. Spruiking. And selling.\n\nBecause I have a history with direct marketing, I was educated about the value of a name and an address. (No internet. No email. In 1994). I asked everyone who purchased if they would like to become part of my mailing list. To keep in touch. And had forms available for them to fill out their details. A surprisingly high 80% said yes.   \n\n1. Why did you start off with mail-orders only?\n\nThe above is why. And how. I started my mailorder business.\n\nAs soon as we returned from an event, I wrote a handwritten thank you note to everyone who gave me their name and address. It was a simple note. Saying how much I loved the fact they chose us above everyone else. I also included a photocopied brochure. Asking them to save it for future orders. Or to pass it on to a friend or family member.\n\nAnd once a year we mailed a brochure, run off our photocopier, to these names and addresses. And built up a mailing list that's in the tens of thousands today.\n\nWhen the internet arrived in our rural village in February 2001, we were ready. And launched our internet site on day 1. With the help of marketing students from Charles Sturt University in Bathurst NSW. Our closest regional centre. They were happy to take us on for free as a class project. And we benefitted from their enthusiasm.\n\nBy 2008, our internet business had grown to the stage where we were receiving more orders online than the volume of product we were selling at events. The internet was international. Events were local.\n\nSo we hung up our car keys. And the wheels of our car did a little jig!\n\nMay I say first, Kristin, if you already have funds to start your business, you're so much further ahead than we were. We had nothing.\n\nHow you spend them is dependent on your goals. What you want to achieve in the short term. And the long term.\n\nI know nothing about the market for athletic wear, but I'll ask you some questions.\n\nWhat are your long-term goals? And short-term goals?\n\nDo your short-term goals segue into your long-term goals?\n\nDoes your athletic wear need to be explained? Or are the benefits obvious?\n\nHow different is it to other athletic wear? And why? \n\nWhy did you develop it? What need are you addressing that other athletic wear doesn't? Or can't?\n\nDo you want to wholesale to on-sellers?\n\nOr do you want to develop personal relationships with customers one-on-one?\n\nIt's hard to have both relationships.\n\nOn-sellers view your own retail site as competition. And they will often discount your product. Leaving you vulnerable in your one-on-one relationships. Customers today shop around. Voraciously. They know where the bargains are. Which is why no one else sells my products except me.\n\nAs far as helping you further is concerned, I only know about my business. And how to run it. \n\nMy values are not often aligned with the values of other people. In the short term, I'm more interested in building love and loyalty. Because I know the money will follow that. It's not the priorities of most people. And may not be a priority that you can afford to indulge in right now.\n\nWhen it comes to your next step, there are members of this forum who are eminently more qualified than me to give you advice. And I'm sure there will be an abundance of good advice proffered.\n\nIt's been a pleasure to meet you, Kristin. I'm touched that you would ask me these questions. And I wish you and your husband only the very best. ~Carol\u2764", "Carol Jones said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nGood morning @Kristin R from Oz,\n\nA big thank you to you and your husband for taking the time to read such a long thread!

They weren't really interested in us. Or in most of their suppliers. And would cut short most telephone conversations. There was nothing in it for them to develop a personal relationship.\n\nWe had no money for advertising, so we hit the road. Spruiking about our products anywhere we could set up a microphone. We demonstrated why our Fitz Like A Glove\u2122 Ironing Board Cover was different to everything else on the market. And told our story loud enough for passers-by to hear. Who rewarded us by buying our products.\n\nI had never spruiked before. Was horrified at the thought. But an experienced gal in the agricultural show business stopped at our stall. Showed me how to do it. Convinced me sales would soar if I got the attention of passersby. And on my first spruik, I scored a sale of 3 covers from a passerby! I was hooked. And never looked back.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2008, we travelled at least 60,000kms per year. Spruiking. And selling.\n\nBecause I have a history with direct marketing, I was educated about the value of a name and an address. (No internet. No email. In 1994). I asked everyone who purchased if they would like to become part of my mailing list. To keep in touch. And had forms available for them to fill out their details. A surprisingly high 80% said yes. \n\n1. Why did you start off with mail-orders only?\n\nThe above is why. And how. I started my mailorder business.\n\nAs soon as we returned from an event, I wrote a handwritten thank you note to everyone who gave me their name and address. It was a simple note. Saying how much I loved the fact they chose us above everyone else. I also included a photocopied brochure. Asking them to save it for future orders. Or to pass it on to a friend or family member.\n\nAnd once a year we mailed a brochure, run off our photocopier, to these names and addresses. And built up a mailing list that's in the tens of thousands today.\n\nWhen the internet arrived in our rural village in February 2001, we were ready. And launched our internet site on day 1. With the help of marketing students from Charles Sturt University in Bathurst NSW. Our closest regional centre. They were happy to take us on for free as a class project. And we benefitted from their enthusiasm.\n\nBy 2008, our internet business had grown to the stage where we were receiving more orders online than the volume of product we were selling at events. The internet was international. Events were local.\n\nSo we hung up our car keys. And the wheels of our car did a little jig!\n\nMay I say first, Kristin, if you already have funds to start your business, you're so much further ahead than we were. We had nothing.\n\nHow you spend them is dependent on your goals. What you want to achieve in the short term. And the long term.\n\nI know nothing about the market for athletic wear, but I'll ask you some questions.\n\nWhat are your long-term goals? And short-term goals?\n\nDo your short-term goals segue into your long-term goals?\n\nDoes your athletic wear need to be explained? Or are the benefits obvious?\n\nHow different is it to other athletic wear? And why?\n\nWhy did you develop it? What need are you addressing that other athletic wear doesn't? Or can't?\n\nDo you want to wholesale to on-sellers?\n\nOr do you want to develop personal relationships with customers one-on-one?\n\nIt's hard to have both relationships.\n\nOn-sellers view your own retail site as competition. And they will often discount your product. Leaving you vulnerable in your one-on-one relationships. Customers today shop around. Voraciously. They know where the bargains are. Which is why no one else sells my products except me.\n\nAs far as helping you further is concerned, I only know about my business. And how to run it.\n\nMy values are not often aligned with the values of other people. In the short term, I'm more interested in building love and loyalty. Because I know the money will follow that. It's not the priorities of most people. And may not be a priority that you can afford to indulge in right now.\n\nWhen it comes to your next step, there are members of this forum who are eminently more qualified than me to give you advice. And I'm sure there will be an abundance of good advice proffered.\n\nIt's been a pleasure to meet you, Kristin. I'm touched that you would ask me these questions. And I wish you and your husband only the very best. ~Carol\u2764Click to expand...\n\n\nThank you so very much for going into this explicit detail for me. The story of your dog collar endeavor was very helpful and interesting. I bet your sweet dog loved his collar as did others whose owners made the purchase. It\u2019s too bad that the chips fell as they did, because it seems like you really did create a valuable product. Obviously, things turned around for you though!\n\nThe interactions that you have had with retailers are very eye-opening. I will definitely keep your experience in mind to avoid similar conflicts in the future\u2026\n\nHow awesome that you were approached by someone who helped you spruik! I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ve ever heard of that word, but I can infer what it means by the context.  The idea of  spruiking is not very appealing to me, either, but I do think that it could be a tool for @Greg R  and I in the beginning.\n\nHow did you end up getting the attention of passerby\u2019s? I have done something like this once, and I remember feeling so awkward trying to get people to notice my booth.\n\nWe have started to tap into online advertising, which has the potential to grab the mases. Still, I do like the idea of a little face-to-face promotion.

Perhaps we will try a healthy mix of both online and in-person\u2026\n\nLong term, we want to be endorsed by a major female athlete.\n\nShort term, we want to generate sales from active females of all kinds. I can go into further detail in a private message if that\u2019s okay with you!\n\nThe product is self-explanatory, but there may be some variations that will need to be explained, which we plan to do on our website and in ads. We are creating something that is different than anything currently out there. We consider the product to be a unique improvement on an existing product.\n\nWhen it comes to wholesale versus direct-to-consumer, I THINK we are leaning towards more towards the direct-to-consumer path. It is definitely something to evaluate. I sincerely appreciate that you have taken the time to answer my questions. Your answers have sparked a lot of thoughts and questions in my head, and I am very grateful for the information.\n\nI hope to report back to you in the near future with new developments!\n\nCheers,\nKristin", "Carol Jones said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nI can't abide rudeness.

Not so much to sell. But to get the reaction from the interested public as to what you're presenting to them.\n\nIf you are prepared to ask the right questions, rather than launch into sell mode, this is where you will learn what to tell visitors to your website about your product.\n\nQuestions to ask are. And you always start out with their story first.\n\nWhat active wear do they currently have?\n\nWhat do they like about it?\n\nWhat don't they like about it?\n\nHow did they find out about it?\n\nIs it comfortable?\n\nWhatever else you think is important. These questions will evolve and change as you become more experienced in selling your product.\n\nWhen assessing this information, then ask them if you can show them your product. And ask for feedback.\n\nDo they like it?\n\nExactly why? What are all the features they like?\n\nWhat are the benefits to them?\n\nHow do they think they will feel wearing your range? (This is the emotion you want to elicit. Emotion is what sells.)\n\nWhy not? Can they elaborate as to why not?\n\nAnd go from there.\n\nAt the end of all this, you will either sell to them at your event. Without having to ask. Or you won't. But if you don't, you will know why. Which most businesses never know. Why someone doesn't buy. And it's rarely ever about price.\n\n\n\nKristin R said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nLong term, we want to be endorsed by a major female athlete.Click to expand...\n\nThat's a plus. But expensive.

It's not personally rewarding. But for many, it's lucrative. And not as time-consuming.\n\nOn the downside, if an establishment drops you, there goes your income from them. And then you have to scramble to replace it.\n\nFinding your own customers. Like we did. Is much more difficult. And means you are constantly looking for new markets.\n\nBut that, to me, is the challenge of being in business.\n\nI've spent more than 15 years looking for a key to unlock a door that was akin to breaking into Fort Knox. I finally found it. And find myself in the position of being able to offer my product range - exclusively - no competitors - to a membership list of 36,000 men and women who iron. It's the equivalent of a captive audience.\n\nI am so very excited.\n\nWhat was attractive to this organisation is that I've no presence in retail stores. So what I'm offering their members is the ability to buy products that are not readily available to their members elsewhere. And once they purchase my ironing board cover. There are 5 other products they can also purchase.\n\nThat is what excited the directors of this organisation.\n\nBusinesses walk on both sides of the street.\n\nWholesaling.\n\nAnd selling direct to customers.\n\nHow you get your product into the marketplace is totally dependent on what is personally the best fit for you. And what sort of relationships you want to build into your business life.\n\nI'm delighted I was of help, Kristin. And please keep me in the loop. You can contact me anytime with a personal message.

But he feels obligated to stay. Without interfering. Just to stop me from being arrested.\n\nWhen we first started out, we were working with a company on our first product.\n\nWhen we arrived to pick up the finished product, it was a complete stuff up.\n\nThe owner of the company, which was a relatively small company, took no responsibility. He simply blamed the problem on an employee.\n\nI snapped. Got up on my soapbox. And pointed out to him that as the owner of the company, the buck stopped with him. And how dare he be spineless and accuse an employee. When he assured us he would be in charge of quality control.\n\nThat was just for starters.\n\nI actually don't remember the rest.\n\nVictor told me I was so angry, he was ready to pull me off the owner. Just in case it was necessary.\n\nWhen he could get a word in edgewise, the owner assured us the problem would be fixed by 3pm.\n\nWhen we returned at 3pm, Victor politely asked me to stay in the car. Which I did.\n\nWhen he met with the owner, the owner looked around. And asked where 'she' was. Victor assured him 'she' was locked in the car. For his safety.\n\nHe then proceeded to commiserate with Victor about having to deal with a 'sheila' like me every day. \n\nWe found another supplier.\n\nIt's a pleasure to exchange stories, Gary.

And find out for myself!Click to expand...\n\nG'day again Jason @JAJT from Oz,\n\nWhat a small world it really is. Up until you dropped in yesterday to say G'day, I had no idea who you were. Or what you did.\n\nI've read about half of your thread and stopped. So I could share with you where I am with puzzles.\n\nI'm an amateur photographer. With - fortunately - a very good eye. I can quickly frame a photo and know it's going to be a good shot. I also have an exceptionally good long range, superzoom digital camera. Which you need when you're photographing wildlife in the distance. Which are always on the move.\n\nI live and work from my remote 54 hectare (135 acres) beautiful rural property that's located in the hill country of a very picturesque part of rural Australia. On the east coast.\n\nEvery morning at sunrise, I talk a walk on my property. With my camera around my neck. Photograph what I see. And choose one photo every morning to post to my social media accounts.\n\nBecause we emphasise that we are a rural business, I also use my photos on my website. In all my newsletters. And in my emails to customers and prospects.\n\nI've been taking these photos since 2012. And have hundreds of thousands stored on my desktop.\n\nI receive enough compliments on a regular basis regarding the photos, to know they're very appealing to people. And are often asked the following:\n\nCan I purchase one as wall art? No. I don't have the facility to produce them. Nor do I want to.\n\nWill I do a calendar? No. The online world is awash with calendars.\n\nWhat about a book of your photos? No. Too expensive. \n\nTea towels? That doesn't really excite me.\n\nFridge magnets? No. I can't see that being a good market for me.\n\nCards. That's a maybe. But how many people send cards these days?\n\nWhat stopped me in my tracks this February was a customer. Who told me that every time I post a photo of the kangaroos that roam my land, her grandchildren, whom she looks after 3 days a week while their mother and father go out to work, are mesmerised by their images. Being an artist, and a dedicated grandmother who is besotted with her grandchildren, she asked me if I had ever thought about turning my photos into puzzles for young children.\n\nEspecially as the wildlife that I photograph - kangaroos, exotic birds, wild goats, sheep that my neighbour agists onto my property, my neighbour's horses -  are rarely seen by children in the city. \n\nThat idea excited me! Because. I'm a jigsaw puzzle fan. Have been since my parents gave me a jigsaw puzzle as a child.\n\nIt's also an excellent way to use my photographs. And a different way to generate revenue from them.\n\nI already have a cultivated market for grandchildren. My customers. Who are mature. Many of them grandparents. Who could see them as a perfect gift for their grandchildren.\n\nI'm 3 weeks into this venture. And this is where I am at right now.\n\nWe are dedicated to having everything we offer to the public made in Australia. Our quality. And made in Austalia. Are major selling points for us.\n\nI didn't think that puzzle making was a big venture in Oz. But my partner, Victor, did a quick scan of Google and found several pages of makers here.\n\nMost of the puzzle makers do one-off personal puzzles. They will turn any photo into a puzzle. Your wedding. Favourite photo of your child. A special event. Becomes a puzzle. \n\nWhat an eye-opener that was for us.\n\nSo that was hurdle number one jumped.\n\nMy interest in photography is in the morning walk. And the taking of the photos. And posting them to my social media accounts. \n\nI'm not particularly interested in curating my photos. But Victor is very interested. He's been at me for several years to do something constructive with them. When he sees an exceptionally good photo, he says, 'that's one for the wall.' \n\nAnd he's also excited by the puzzle venture.\n\nHe's talked to several puzzle makers. And has chosen one he thinks is more suitable for us. Especially as they specialise in puzzles for children. They make puzzles for the Department of Education for young children.\n\nThey can make puzzles that are 30 large pieces. Or 60 smaller pieces. They also make 500 piece puzzles. And 1000 piece puzzles.\n\nAnd they also have no minimum purchase requirement. One puzzle is fine for them.\n\nIt's a husband and wife team who showed more interest in our venture than the other puzzle makers. And are more than happy for Victor to send them a photo. Which they will make into a puzzle. And send to us as a sample.\n\nBecause we don't know if this will be successful or not, Victor wants to offer the puzzles on our website as custom made-to-order only. So we're not holding stock. Customers can choose their puzzle from 'X' number of photos.\n\nThis puzzle maker has a guaranteed 2-day turnaround time per order. And is happy to mail direct to our customer. Which means we're eliminating one cost. Which is the Australia Post charge to get the puzzles to us. And then us to mail to our customer. Australia Post is one of the most expensive postal services in the world. And double posting is dead money.\n\nWhether we do that depends on how the product is presented when we open the parcel. I'm very fussy about the fact that when customers open a parcel from me, it should be akin to receiving a gift in the mail. So we'll see about that one.\n\nVictor has cast his architect's eye over the photos. He's also a very talented pencil artist. So his eye is more critical than mine would be. Has chosen about 50 that he thinks will work. And is ready to send a photo to the puzzle maker. For us to receive a sample.\n\nIf I was doubtful before I read your posts. And I was. As we all are when we start a new venture. I'm not now. Your thread has convinced me this is a genuine opportunity. And I'm looking forward to receiving the sample.\n\nBeing in this business for 24 years, I also know that disappointment is just around the corner regarding companies who make things. And I hope this puzzle maker doesn't disappoint. Because then we're back to square one. \n\nI was particularly taken by your comment about puzzle dust. And is definitely something I will be looking for.\n\nThank you, Jason, for your thread. It's been very enlightening. And encouraging. I'll finish reading your thread by the end this week. ~Carol\u2764", "Sounds like a great idea  \n\nWith your experience I'll probably even learn a thing from you along the way! \n\nGlad I could inspire you.

The industry had just imploded. We were accused of not trying hard enough. Which was true. We didn't want jobs.

We learn more from our mistakes. Then we do from our successes.\n\nDoing nothing always gives you the same result. Nothing happens.\n\nIt's always better to do something. \n\nDoing something gives you the chance to Act. Assess. Adjust. From 'Unscripted'. \n\nAnd you learn from doing something. You learn what works. What doesn't. \n\nYou learn how to refine what doesn't work. You change. You re-try. You refine. Until one day you have a modus operandi that works for you.\n\nProfessionals understand this process.\n\nDoctors study for 'X' years before they're allowed to treat a patient. Under supervision.\n\nDitto for lawyers. Architects. Geologists. Archaeologists. Nurses.\n\nFor some reason, men and women think they can hang a shingle out that says . . . 'I'm in business'. And be an expert within 24 hours.\n\nIt doesn't work that way.\n\nAfter 24 years in my business, I'm still learning. And refining.\n\nAnd I have a better business because of it. And I'm a better businesswoman because of it.\n\nIt's a pleasure to meet you. What do you do? And what do you hope to learn from the members of this forum? ~Carol\u2764", "Alicesu said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nWish your business will going smooth.Click to expand...\n\nG'day @Alicesu from Oz,\n\nWelcome to The Fastlane Forum.\n\nThank you!

I care about how people who work for a company are treated. And Amazon has the same reputation as Apple under Steve Jobs. They burn people up. And treat them poorly. And there is nothing about Jeff Bezos personally that I admire.\n\nThis is also why I don't have my products in retail outlets. Retailers are more interested in their bottom line. Than they are in the people who help them earn that bottom line.\n\nIt's harder to do what I'm doing. But the warm relationship I have with my customers is so rewarding. I just love the feedback. My Fitz Like A Glove\u2122 Ironing Board Cover is going to travel the world as the ironing board cover of choice on an $8 million yacht that hosts  8 guests at a time as it cruises Australia and New Zealand. The owner placed the order yesterday. And told me how excited the crew is knowing it will be ironing on the best cover in the world.\n\nButlers and housekeepers in BIG houses in Australia buy my cover. And we've formed very warm friendships. Butlers are amongst my biggest referrals.\n\nI also count celebrities. And members of the BRW Rich List amongst my customers. They're not looking for me on Amazon.\n\nEarlier this year we covered all the boards at the new prestige MacQ01 hotel in Hobart, Tasmania. The hotel group which manages the hotel chose us, even though we were the most expensive cover. Because of our quality. And they love that it's made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability. After they received their order, they asked me to thank the men and women who make the cover. And to tell them how much their dedication to quality is appreciated.\n\nWe all have reasons as to who we choose to do business with. And why. I choose not to travel the route of businesses who have no vested interest in me personally.\n\nI'm alone in this viewpoint, Kerin. My friends think I've got a screw missing. I don't. I instinctively know not to build a business on rented land. Where the rules change at the whim of the landlord. Which is why I don't cultivate Facebook. Amazon. Or any other platform like them.\n\nI'm interested in long-term loyal customers. Who aren't distracted by what else they see when looking at my product range. Which is why I spend my time cultivating them on my land. But. Again. It's a harder road to travel.\n\nI don't have children. But have many friends who do. It's natural to be distracted by your child. They need to be nurtured. And focussed on. That's what makes them. And you. Happy. And confident.

And your generosity.\n\nWe all have different reasons for being in business.\n\nAnd every business is different. Including similar businesses. Franchises may have the same decor. Same food. Same products. But the ambience is always determined by the people who own the franchise. Some are warm and friendly. Others not so much.\n\nIt doesn't matter what kind of business a person owns - I'm not talking about being an employee, but an owner with control - they are in command of why they own the business. And how they will run it.\n\nAnd in 99% of cases, money is always an object!\n\nMost businesses are created to be cash cows only. The owner has only one objective. To make as much money as possible. This was the mantra in the 'greed is good' era of the late 1980's and 1990's. \n\nWhich put an end to those companies who still cared about the welfare of their employees. And their customers.\n\nThat mantra still prevails today.\n\nThere was a time when the way I run my business was the norm. Now it's an anomaly.\n\nThe caring company is making a comeback. But when I talk to customers about how they're treated by most businesses, it's not happening quickly enough.\n\nAnd most employees are of the opinion that their employers are $#%! Very few employees feel valued by the company they work for. Maybe the upper echelons might feel some appreciation. But most employees lower down are treated as if they're expendable.\n\nReally small businesses are the exception. \n\nMedium to large businesses have a disconnect between management and non-management. \n\nWhich is why so many people want to leave those conditions to create their own work environment. And become an 'entrepreneur'.\n\nI'm a giver. And never did well in companies. I was always told I spent too much time with customers. Even though, in the last company I worked for, I brought in 1/3 of their total revenue in new business. I was the only one in sales targetting new business. And I brought it in because I spent time with people. And showed them how much I cared about them.\n\nI'm happy with my lot in life. I would never in a million years willingly start a business selling ironing board covers. But I managed to turn this accidental business into a business that allows me to do so many things that I love to do.\n\nAll of us who own a business are in control of how and why we do what we do. \n\nI often make sacrifices to run my business the way I do. \n\nI've pulled out of joint ventures when I realised the other party has no vested interest in me. It cost me financially. But in every case, it was worth it. And by having to restructure my business, I have a better business.\n\nI also have good instincts. I'm good at saying no, I won't go there. And a spine of steel. So when I say NO to an offer. Most people know I mean it.\n\nHere's to you, Andy, doing what you know is worthwhile. And rewarding.

We have 400,000 customers in 30 countries around the world who think our products are the best thing since sliced bread. The icing on the cake is that all our products are made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability. We are renown for our simple solutions that work. When others don't.\n\nThat's the event.\n\nThe process is this.\n\nIn 1992, my partner and I lost everything in Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating's 'recession we had to have'. We closed down two businesses. My partner's 12 year old architectural practice. My market research consultancy. We farewelled 16 loyal and supportive staff. We sold our home of 22 years. Two cars. And our personal possessions. To pay off what debt we could. And made a scheme of arrangement with our creditors to pay off the remaining debt.\n\nPoor as church mice. We left the city lights of Sydney Australia. For a rural life in a remote village with no internet access. No email. Not even call waiting. But it met our most important criteria. We could live in a farmhouse whose rent we could afford to pay. The village was heavily affected by a severe drought. And the house was not a desirable place to live. But it was our safety net.\n\nWe made a decision to find our way back by utilising simple solutions. Our skills were in design. And research. So we reinvented ourselves as designers and makers of textile products. Our first product didn't capture the hearts of the marketplace. But our second product did. We redesigned the humble ironing board cover utilising a low tech solution to make sure it was firmly anchored to an ironing board. So it never moved. Which is what makes people hate ironing.\n\nIf you make one good product. Customers want more. So we designed 6 more textile products. And today we have more than 400,000 customers in 30 countries. Without any retail distribution. And all done online today. But in the beginning, it was all mail order.\n\nWe've been down dark alleys. Wondered if we were certifiably mad to keep doing what we were doing when ironing board covers are not top of mind with most people.\n\nBut we discovered they are very top of mind with men and women who must iron.\n\nEven though the subject is not sexy, our products, and our story, have been written about in every major publication in Australia.\n\nWe've been featured on mainstream TV. Interviewed on radio. Included in two books. The latest being 'Hunch' by international best selling author Bernadette Jiwa. I'm the 'Ironing Whisperer' on page 73.\n\nThe process of working every day is what got us to where we are today.\n\nWe did what everyone said we couldn't do. We built a worldwide business from broke. On a remote rural property. Before the internet and email came to our rural village.\n\nI'm here to mix with like minded men and women. I have 35 years of business experience to share. I've done the hard yards. And would love to be of help to those of you who can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAnd. I want to travel further along the road to wealth.\n\nIt will be a pleasure to meet you. ~Carol\u2764Click to expand...\n\nWhat an amazing attitude to have.

I applaud you.", "Carol Jones said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nG'day @itsemdub from Oz,\n\nWe had no option but to leave Sydney Australia. We had no means to support ourselves other than the tail end of an architectural project that Victor had to finish. Sydney just wasn't an option. We needed to sell our house to reduce debt. And everything to rent was just too expensive.\n\nLeaving behind everyone we knew was a blessing. We got rid of personal excess baggage.\n\nThey were our friends. And relatives. Who had expectations as to how we would dig ourselves out of our predicament.\n\nWhat were their expectations?\n\nGet a job. They couldn't understand there were no architectural jobs on offer. The industry had just imploded. We were accused of not trying hard enough. Which was true. We didn't want jobs. We didn't want to work for someone else after working for ourselves for 12 years.\n\nMoving away from these friends and relatives meant we could reinvent ourselves in a place where no one knew us. Or our background.\n\nWe were free to become whoever we wanted to become. Without external pressure. Or expectations.\n\nThe fact that it was also cheaper meant we had space to breathe financially. Not much. But we knew we could afford the rent. And the owner of the farmhouse was so desperate to have it rented in the midst of one of the worst droughts ever, there was no chance he was going to increase the rent.\n\nDid it help us weather the storm? Yes. It did. We were in a new environment. And had little time to reflect on what we'd lost.\n\nIt's a pleasure to meet you @itsemdub. I hope this helps you. And welcome to the forum.

This is 24 years ago. Times were different.\n\nThe banks wouldn't lend to us. And wouldn't give us an overdraft. But a friend. Who was an accountant. Told us that the bank would issue a no questions asked credit card for a maximum of $500. Per person.\n\nWe were able to get 2 credit cards with a $500 limit. So we had a slush fund of $1,000 to work with. Which was a fortune to us.\n\nAll our orders were word of mouth. And cash up front. There was no Amazon Prime. Or eBay. That delivered the next day. Everything was mailorder. And people were prepared to wait 30 days to receive their order.\n\nWe would wait until the end of the month to see how many orders we had. And order enough fabric and accessories to fill those orders. So most of what we did came out of cash flow. We had no accounts. So these purchases were cash payments up front for us.\n\nFace to face events and stocking up for them beforehand came out of the credit cards. Which we paid off at the end of every month.\n\nOur marketing consisted of modest events. Which were mainly agricultural shows. And markets. That cost $10. To a maximum of $50. To attend.\n\nWe would leave our farmhouse at 2am to arrive at our destination by 6am. And arrive back at the farmhouse between midnight. And 2am. They were gruelling days.\n\nWe also did letterbox drops. We could do letterbox drops for 3 cents per letter. We produced the leaflets on my computer. And printed them off on our photocopier.\n\nWhen we sold our possessions to pay off debt. We kept some things. My computer. Which was a bulky, boxy, CRT computer with a black screen and green lettering. No graphics. And our photocopier.\n\nVictor, being an architect, was also a very good sketch artist. So our graphics consisted of his pencil sketches of the products.\n\nWe distributed the leaflets to rural areas only. Where rural women were still heavily into ironing. And were used to buying items mailorder. Also, it was rare to see a 'No Junk Mail' sticker on their rural mailboxes.\n\nWe did very well with those leaflets. And were able to build up a strong word of mouth business.\n\nWe led a frugal life.\n\nWe only bought what we needed in the supermarket. No luxuries. No meat. We couldn't afford it. No chocolates.\n\nWe had a vegetable garden. And ate what we could grow.\n\nWe couldn't afford beer. Or wine. Or spirits. Neither of us smoke. We never so much as bought a cup of coffee in a cafe.\n\nWe didn't accept social invitations because we couldn't afford to bring a bottle of wine. Nor could we afford to reciprocate.\n\nThose were hard times. But we had a goal. Which was to get out of debt. And we were prepared to make whatever sacrifices were required to reach that goal.\n\nRegarding copy. All the copy was written by us. I know nothing about those books you mentioned. Or special words.\n\nWe just told our story. And described the products in great detail. And offered everyone a no questions asked money back guarantee if they weren't happy. And a twelve-month wear and tear guarantee. Meaning. We guaranteed that whatever they purchased, they couldn't wear it out in twelve months.\n\nNo one else did that at the time. We were a first. And that gave customers confidence when buying from us.\n\nWe included a black and white brochure, produced on our photocopier, to customers with every order. Including a handwritten thank you note. And mailed to them once a year with another black and white photocopied brochure. Telling them how much we loved them for choosing us over other companies.\n\nThat's how we built this business from nothing. To something. Purely on trust. And a willingness to have a special relationship with people who care enough to buy from us.\n\nThe only special words we use are . . . love . . . thank you . . . we hope you like what you've purchased.\n\nAnd that's how we continue to build this business. By developing trustful, deeply personal relationships with our customers.\n\nWe don't need anything else.\n\nI hope this answers your questions.

We have 400,000 customers in 30 countries around the world who think our products are the best thing since sliced bread. The icing on the cake is that all our products are made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability. We are renown for our simple solutions that work. When others don't.\n\nThat's the event.\n\nThe process is this.\n\nIn 1992, my partner and I lost everything in Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating's 'recession we had to have'. We closed down two businesses. My partner's 12 year old architectural practice. My market research consultancy. We farewelled 16 loyal and supportive staff. We sold our home of 22 years. Two cars. And our personal possessions. To pay off what debt we could. And made a scheme of arrangement with our creditors to pay off the remaining debt.\n\nPoor as church mice. We left the city lights of Sydney Australia. For a rural life in a remote village with no internet access. No email. Not even call waiting. But it met our most important criteria. We could live in a farmhouse whose rent we could afford to pay. The village was heavily affected by a severe drought. And the house was not a desirable place to live. But it was our safety net.\n\nWe made a decision to find our way back by utilising simple solutions. Our skills were in design. And research. So we reinvented ourselves as designers and makers of textile products. Our first product didn't capture the hearts of the marketplace. But our second product did. We redesigned the humble ironing board cover utilising a low tech solution to make sure it was firmly anchored to an ironing board. So it never moved. Which is what makes people hate ironing.\n\nIf you make one good product. Customers want more. So we designed 6 more textile products. And today we have more than 400,000 customers in 30 countries. Without any retail distribution. And all done online today. But in the beginning, it was all mail order.\n\nWe've been down dark alleys. Wondered if we were certifiably mad to keep doing what we were doing when ironing board covers are not top of mind with most people.\n\nBut we discovered they are very top of mind with men and women who must iron.\n\nEven though the subject is not sexy, our products, and our story, have been written about in every major publication in Australia.\n\nWe've been featured on mainstream TV. Interviewed on radio. Included in two books. The latest being 'Hunch' by international best selling author Bernadette Jiwa. I'm the 'Ironing Whisperer' on page 73.\n\nThe process of working every day is what got us to where we are today.\n\nWe did what everyone said we couldn't do. We built a worldwide business from broke. On a remote rural property. Before the internet and email came to our rural village.\n\nI'm here to mix with like minded men and women. I have 35 years of business experience to share. I've done the hard yards. And would love to be of help to those of you who can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAnd.

And welcome to The Fastlane Forum. It's a privilege to be able to inspire you.\n\nHard work is the harbinger of success. The only time success comes before work is in the dictionary. Once you grasp how hard you do have to work. And are willing to put in the effort required to reach your goal, you're guaranteed to get to where you want to be.\n\nYour success might not look exactly like you expect it to look. And many of us don't recognise it when we see it. I'm still living back at the beginning of our journey. At the coalface. Working as hard as ever to make sure I stay on the first page of Google for my best search term. With increased competition every day.\n\nSuccess isn't a word I apply to myself. But I must be successful. Because a lifestyle program is going to film me. And my story. For their lifestyle channel. The cameras arrive on September 12th! They found out about me from three people in different businesses who suggested to them they contact me. I'm still amazed. Even though this is my 3rd time in front of TV cameras!\n\n\n\nGepi said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nIroning is no fun with bad fitting covers, indeed!Click to expand...\n\nWho would have thought that a low tech, humble ironing board cover that, albeit, solves a big problem for people, would catapult a small business in a remote rural village in Australia, that was started by a couple escaping financial ruin, onto the world stage?\n\nWorking hard, Gesa, and constantly building on what you have, no matter how tough the circumstances. Rather than chopping and changing when the going gets tough. Takes us all to places we never dreamed possible.  \n\nA word of advice. Always help people get to where they want to be. Because it's a sure way to get to where you want to be. Those are famous words from Zig Ziglar. And they are so true.

It's also a pleasure to meet you. And welcome to The Fastlane Forum. You'll find so many people here who will inspire you. And help you on your journey.\n\nAs you're just starting out, I have some advice.\n\nOnly listen to people who are going to buy your product. Or your service. They're the ones who will open their wallet and pay for what you have. Their feedback is the only important feedback to listen to. Everyone else is a tyre kicker. Including your family. And friends.\n\nMistakes. Failures. Are all learning experiences. Build on what you have. One layer at a time. That's how skyscrapers are built. One storey at a time. As the partner of a gifted architect, I can assure you that many things go wrong on the way up to the penthouse. But builders don't tear a building down and start again somewhere else. They've invested in this building. And solve their problems on the hop. As all of us in business do. One step forward. Two steps backwards. Is sometimes de rigueur. \n\nYou will have times of extreme discouragement. This is when mentors can pull you out of a deep funk. Find people online who you admire and who create podcasts. And videos. And watch or listen to one or more of them daily. They do inspire. And educate.\n\nWhen the going gets really tough. Write your goals down. Again. I write mine down every day. Just so I don't get distracted. As a lover of bright shiny objects, I have to curtail my curiosity. Just by writing my goals down every day. Day after day. I've learned to become very focussed. And when I'm spinning my wheels, I write even loftier goals. Which sometimes make me laugh. But always make me feel better about the future.\n\nIf you're prepared to put in the truly hard work to get to the top, you'll get there. I'm a 24-year work in progress. My goals always shift a level higher once I reach a goal. I'm never stagnant. Even though I can spin my wheels at times!\n\nBest wishes, Victor! If I can ever help you, please let me know.

And don't have the courage when they're really struggling to stand up to the flak they get from family and friends because they haven't reached 'success' in the time frame determined by other people.\n\nWe've been there.\n\nVictor's parents are a good example. \"How come my son, the architect, is now a purveyor of ironing board covers\"? They couldn't understand that the 'recession we had to have' decimated the building industry. There was no work for architects for 10 years in Australia. And. They were embarrassed at telling their friends that their son made ironing board covers. Instead of designing tall buildings.\n\nThey also couldn't resign themselves to the fact that before the recession we were a very wealthy business couple. With a high profile in the Sydney Australia business community. I was on 3 boards of directors. And Victor was the developers' dream architect.\n\nAnd afterwards. We were flat broke. With no real prospects for earning an income. I'm sure it caused them a great deal of personal pain.\n\nFriends. Perhaps mean well. But were insistent that we get a job. Rather than fiddle around with something so trivial as an ironing board cover. \"Who irons anyway? Doesn't everyone hate it?\"\n\nOur accountant. \"You're not making enough money. You can't start a business in the depths of the worst recession Australia's ever had. Why don't you both just knuckle under and get a real job?\"\n\nAnd then the strangers we meet. \"You really make a living out of selling ironing board covers\"? Well not yet. But we will!\n\nThen there's the disapproval from people because the product isn't sexy. Glamourous. High tech. The fact that people who are serious about ironing think it's the best thing since sliced bread doesn't matter.\n\nThe banks. \"We can't lend you money. Nobody irons. Who are you going to sell to\"? How about the 400,000 men and women in 30 countries? Just as starters.\n\nThe disapproval. And flak. Comes from all directions. And entrepreneurs starting out need to know they have to have a spine of steel to withstand the assault. And once you get over the hump, and realise your dream is possible, life doesn't get easy. But your faith and confidence in yourself increases. You become more focused on where you want to be. And more determined to get there.\n\nOnce you reach that stage, you start to stand up to your dissenters. And put them in their place. Including family.\n\nThat's why I want to share my story. To let entrepreneurs know that anything is possible. You just have to find a way to make it happen. Against all odds.Click to expand...\n\nLove this part. You have endured so much. The worst comes from family. It hurts the most. Would you agree?\n\nDid you stop trying to explain it to your parents? Did you stop talking to each other?

Thank you.\n\nI can remember when I was 23 years old. And I would tell you. And everyone else that age. And older.\n\nThat there are two things we need to address.\n\nThe first is that there are no limits to what you can do. Or achieve.\n\nWe put limits on ourselves. And hold ourselves back.\n\nNo one else holds us back. Just ourselves. Lack of belief in what we're capable of doing. That's the big hurdle to jump over. Especially if other people are telling you it can't be done.\n\nI always tell people that to change yourself, you have to change the story in your head that you tell yourself. It takes practice. But it does happen. Tony Robbins is an expert at that.\n\nAnd.\n\nThe second thing is to simply take action.\n\nStop thinking. And start doing. Be prepared to make mistakes. Victor and I have made so many mistakes. But we learned from every one of them. And we have a better business because of them.\n\nFailure is NOT making mistakes. Failure is NOT DOING!\n\nSetbacks are part of the process. Victor and I just experienced one this week. While Victor was in a state of despair. I told him that every time we have a setback, we find a better way to do something. And we come out the other side so much better off.\n\nAnd we did. The setback this week. Although crucial. Made us make a change. And that change has made our business better.\n\nHave belief in yourself, Limitless4Life. Setbacks. Mistakes. They're part of the process that takes you further along the road to wealth.\n\nLife is to be lived. And it's never perfect. I hope this helps. Never hesitate to ask me for help.

They're appreciated!\n\nWhen we first started exhibiting at events, we realised there were too many scammers with inferior products on offer. So to set ourselves apart, we offered a 12-month wear and tear guarantee. And to prove we wanted to keep our word, we asked each customer for their mailing address. So we could notify them when their guarantee was about to expire. \n\nThis was 1994. The internet had not yet arrived in Australia. So everything was done by mail. It was also how we built up our mailing list.\n\nWe are very mindful that there are no repeat customers if a product doesn't live up to its promise. And being an ex-market researcher, I know the value of honest feedback. \n\nAlso. Victor and I are the only ones who answer the phone. And we want to engage in only pleasant conversations!\n\nSo the Twelve-Month Check Up has been in effect since day 1.\n\nWhat have we discovered?\n\nThat when people fill their steam iron with water. And the water spills onto the cover. The natural reaction is to iron the cover dry. Which results in a scorched. And often burnt cover. So we now include instructions NOT to do that.\n\n\nTwice, we discovered that suppliers were sending us a component inferior to what we ordered. On the surface, they looked the same. But they weren't passing the test of time. The Twelve-Month Check Up flushed that out. And we were able to solve those problems. And keep customers.\n\nWe were also given so many reasons why people like their product. Which helps us in our marketing. And adds to our burgeoning list of testimonials. Which now runs to 60 A4 pages.\n\nEvery month, without fail, I send out my Twelve-Month Check Up. I haven't been asked to replace a product this year. But I know I've generated massive amounts of trust. Which money can't buy.\n\nWe look at everything we do from a customer's point of view. We willingly walk over broken glass to make sure they are happy with their purchase. And their buying experience.\n\nHow simple is that?\n\nThank you for dropping in, @pkom79.

In 1994, there was no internet. Everything was done via direct mail.\n\nMarkets. Home shows. Large agricultural shows were also thriving. It was easy to set up a display and spruik the virtues of your product. Crowds were thick. And hungry to buy. We did so well. That at some events, I didn't have a box big enough for all the money. At one event, an exhibitor came to help me pick up the money that fell on the floor!\n\nThose live events have fallen out of favour. People don't make time for them on a weekend any more.\n\nPeople were also more responsive to direct mail. We posted a brochure to our customers every November. We would receive orders within 24 hours of posting. By telephone. Within 3 days of posting. Our post office box was jam packed full of orders. This would continue for weeks.\n\nPrinting costs and postage rates make direct mail no longer viable.\n\nWe also were engaged with customers and prospects by telephone. We had so many opportunities to explain what we did. Voice to voice. I rarely lost a prospect on the telephone.\n\nThe anonymity of the internet is problematic to someone like me who likes to engage personally with people. People come to your site. And you can't talk to them. Yes. There are chatbots. But the visitor has to make the first move. And can disengage at any point. People rarely cut you off on the telephone.\n\nBecause of the internet, consumers today are more savvy. Better educated. And approach you knowing far more about competitors in your market. And are less likely to want to engage on a more personal basis.\n\nAnd. Because we went online in 2001. When the internet reached our rural village. I was able to establish myself on Google with very little competition. It didn't take long for me to be on page one for my best search term. And that remains so today. Without spending a penny on advertising. But I doubt that if I was starting out now, that would ever be a possibility.\n\nSo yes, Paul. We would have to do everything different today. New circumstances. New rules. I'm saved by the fact that I have very loyal customers on my database. Some who have been buying from me since 1994. I engage often with them. They send me referrals. And also reorder when appropriate. \n\nBut the playing field is totally different.  And it's a much tougher playing field. Loads of competition. And much noise!\n\nI hope this answers your question. Thank you for asking. And it's a pleasure to meet you. ~Carol\u2764", "pkom79 said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\n@Carol Jones\nMost of the e-commerce business owners I know (myself included) wouldn't have the guts to ask a question like this in fear that customers would start massively returning their orders just to take advantage of the opportunity.

You underestimate the integrity of your customer. If they like your product. And you've treated them with respect. They don't take advantage of you.\n\nIf. On the other hand, you do nothing more than bombard them with 'buy more' emails! They'll treat you with the disdain you deserve.\n\nEvery month I send an email to customers who have purchased the month before. To say thank you. We love you. And we hope you're happy with your purchase. And your buying experience. There's never a request to buy. But I do remind them that with their order, they received a Gift Certificate for a saving on any product they choose. And it expires with their Twelve Month Wear And Tear Guarantee. \n\nThree months into their Twelve Month Wear and Tear Guarantee, I send them an email to say they have 9 months left. And I hope all is well. There is no request to make another purchase. Just a reminder that their Gift Certificate expires with their guarantee.\n\nSix months into their Twelve Month Wear and Tear Guarantee, I send them an email to say they have 6 months left. If there are any problems, please let me know. There is no request to make another purchase. Just a reminder that their Gift Certificate expires with their guarantee.\n\nNine months into their Twelve Month Wear and Tear Guarantee, I send them an email to say they have 3 months left. I hope they are still problem free. But in case they're not, please let me know. There is no request to make another purchase. I also tell them I'll be contacting them again in 2 months to let them know their Twelve Month Wear and Tear Guarantee will expire in 4 weeks. And their Gift Certificate for a saving on any product expires with that guarantee.\n\nAt the bottom of each email is a film strip of all my products. With a link to my website. With no direct request to make a purchase. \n\nDo they buy a different product? Of course they do. They see what I have to offer every quarter. And it motivates them to buy. Especially as I remind them that the Gift Certificate that came with their product 12 months ago. Expires with their guarantee. We get a good conversion rate on that last email.\n\nAnd. With every new purchase. They get another Gift Certificate for a saving that's good for another twelve months.\n\nNever underestimate the integrity of a customer who is told they're appreciated. Loved. And respected. 5 times in twelve months. It's a callous person who will take advantage of that merchant. And believe me, they don't buy my ironing board covers! \n\nRegarding your questions.\n\nI've never spent a penny on online advertising. I'm on page one of Google for my best search term. And have been there since 2001. I spend a great deal of time making sure my position is never challenged.\n\nThe bulk of my orders are referrals. Re-orders. Gifts. Joint ventures. Google represents the smallest piece of the pie. \n\nThank you for being interested @pkom79. Treat your customers well.

Sometimes what we have to do is so monotonous as to be boring. But it means everything to a customer. And a follower of your blog. Or Instagram or Facebook account. To post on a regular basis.\n\nI have an A4 (Australian size) monthly planner that sits on my desk. In addition to my daily diary. It's 30/31 days in squares. To two A4 pages. And every day it tells me the repetitive communications I need to make regarding emails to be sent. Social media posts to be made.\n\nA few years ago I befriended a business coach. Not to help me. Just someone I met on LinkedIn. One of her posts was about the nitty-gritty that we have to do every day to keep customers and prospects engaged. And how much of what we do is repetitive. And not glamourous.\n\nI'm a fan of Amy Porterfield. I love her podcasts. And she is always talking about the importance of being consistent.\n\nAs I am of Dan Kennedy. Who is one of the greatest direct marketers of all time. I've studied all of his books. And I've immortalised on my desk one of his sayings. \"Self-discipline is the magic power that makes you unstoppable\".\n\nI have a small teddy bear.  Sent to me by my sister 20 years ago. It sits on the top of a bookshelf in my office. Just above my computer. Its black button eyes peering down at me. Whenever I don't feel like doing something, I look up at that teddy bear's eyes rivetting into me. And look at Dan Kennedy's words about self-discipline. And I do what I know I have to do. To take that one step today. That gets me further along the Yellow Brick Road to the bigger picture.\n\nLike you. I've never had a bad experience asking customers if they're happy with their product. Constructive criticism is so helpful. If you listen to it, it makes your business not only so much better. But much more successful than your competitors.\n\nGet a monthly planner. And diarise every month the day you want to get in contact with your customers. And what questions you want to ask them. You know you will never regret it.\n\nThank you @amp0193 for sharing your story with me. I love knowing how other people do things.

I'm curious if it's a matter of principal or some other reason.\nRolls Royce runs FB ads in some markets Click to expand...\n\nG'day again @pkom79 \n\nNo. I've never considered advertising online.\n\nWe started our business 7 years before the internet came to our rural village in Australia in 2001. And it was another 7 years before the rest of Australia embraced online shopping. So we've had 14 years of developing our business offline. Before online shopping became an accepted form of shopping.\n\nDuring that time we nurtured our database. With a yearly mailout of brochures. Monthly emails as described previously. And a monthly newsletter.\n\nThese are more productive to us than advertising online. Your best customers are your current customers. Who also become ambassadors. Singing your praises to their friends and family.\n\nRegarding social media. The operative word is social. \n\nBrands doing well on social media are selling hope. Cosmetics. Weight loss. Get rich quick schemes. Real estate. Luxury cars. \n\nRolls Royce may do well on Facebook. But given they are a luxury product. They are in a different class to us.\n\nOur product is 'work'. It's a chore. People can't decide what they hate most. Ironing their clothes. Or cleaning their toilets. They can buy clothes they don't need to iron. But it's hard to not clean your toilet.\n\nWe discovered early on when exhibiting that it was the death knell for us to be placed near fun items like jewellery. Travel. Wine. Food. \n\nMore than once, visitors to our exhibit were about to buy ironing board covers. But were distracted by the bright shiny objects on sale right next door. We were suddenly told they couldn't afford us. Only to go next door and make a more expensive purchase.\n\nOnce we learned this, we always opted for our own exhibition pagodas away from the more alluring items that people prefer to focus on. This transformed our financial results in a positive way when exhibiting. Customers could focus only on us. And our products. And not all the bright shiny objects around us.\n\nSo many customers tell me they tell all their friends on Facebook how great our products are. I can't remember ever being told someone found us as a result of a comment on Facebook. And I ask. Every time. \n\nThe daughter-in-law of my oldest friend in Australia uses our ironing board covers. She's 42.  And has a substantial number of loyal friends who follow her on Facebook. Many of them iron because their children go to schools where they wear uniforms and have a dress code. She loves her cover. And asked if she could be an affiliate. Of course she could. She also was an affiliate marketer for very expensive scented candles.\n\nHer friends preferred to spend $75 on a scented candle that would last a few weeks at most. Than $44.95 on an ironing board cover that solved all the problems they hate about ironing. And that would last for several years. She never did sell a cover to any of her friends. \n\nFriends ask each other on Facebook for the names of local plumbers. Electricians. House painters. But people don't look for solutions to their own daily chores on social media. \n\nThey look for them on Google. \n\nAnd I'm so established offline with my communications with my customers, that I don't want to advertise with Google. Personally, I hate being stalked by ads. 3 years ago we were looking for dining room chairs online. Every site we visited after that, we were bombarded with ads from the sites we visited. That's when I put Adblocker on all my computers.  And I refused to buy from any company that stalked me. We found the chairs we wanted offline.\n\nMy customers are of a mature age. They're not millennials. They have a different worldview of how they want to be treated online. And they don't want to be pestered. Or stalked.\n\nDoes this answer your questions, @pkom79? ~Carol\u2764", "Carol Jones said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nYour best customers are your current customersClick to expand...\n\n100%\n\n\n\nCarol Jones said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nBut were distracted by the bright shiny objects on sale right next door.

They WILL NEVER understand why you threw away a good job to follow your dream. No matter how much money you make.\n\nProving them wrong is a hollow victory. Based on negative vibes. You actually achieve this based on someone else's expectations of what you should be doing. \n\nProving yourself right is the greatest reward. And is full of joy. Because its foundation is based on what you want to do. What path you want to follow.

And relocated to the alpine region of the state of Victoria. Still in Australia. We are in the rural foothills of Mt Hotham. Victoria's premier ski resort. We've purchased another rural property, 42 hectares (105 acres). My partner, Victor Pleshev, is an architect. And he's designing a house for us to build on this property.\n\nThe property is very steep. And we will build our house on the top of a hill. Which has 360 degree panoramic views of a valley below of farmland. And the stunning surrounding hills that form a part of Mt Hotham. So we'll be able to see the snow caps in winter. We also have a seasonal creek at the base of the property which flows freely during winter. When rain is plentiful.\n\nTo your question. What niche do we currently occupy? Ironing board covers! We've created an enviable reputation for our product living up to its name - Fitz Like A Glove\u2122 Ironing Board Cover. We also have almost 500,000 customers. in 30 countries. It would be foolish to abandon this market segment. Especially as fewer people are ironing every year. So makers of ironing board covers are dropping out of the market. Which means their exit. Is my gain. There will be fewer and fewer choices for people who want a quality ironing board cover.\n\nNo. We don't invent our own products. We choose existing products that don't work. And redesign them so they do work. When others don't work. We've done this with 6 products.\n\nOur products are textile products. With the exception of my jigsaw puzzles. Which are created from my photographs taken in rural Australia. Photography is my hobby.\n\nWe don't make cheap products. And don't look for cheap options. The cheap category is full to the brim with competition. We choose quality over cheap. And price our products accordingly. There's less competition at the quality end.\n\nPeople buy our products as a last resort. When they've burned through the cheap products and finally convince themselves that quality is worth it. They buy from us. We're very patient.\n\nAll our products are made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability. So we don't look for manufacturing alternatives. Comments from customers confirm that many of them buy from us because we give challenged people an opportunity to participate in the workforce. Which enhances their self-esteem.\n\nI hope this answers your questions, Sam.\n\nAnd welcome to The Fastlane Forum. You'll meet so many talented people on this forum. Who give. And who are very helpful.\n\nIf I can help you in any way, please let me know.

And life becomes very busy.\n\nLOVE the podcast. How wonderful of you to send me the link. I love stories like this. \n\nAge. Experience. And the wisdom that comes with age. Allows me to travel under the radar. And know that it's the best route for me. \n\nI can't remember a time when I've been attracted to fads. And have always avoided them. Even in high school and university. When peer pressure is very strong to follow the pack. I've learned that I'm often on the outside. And many times, when looking inside, I've observed the mistakes people make in trying to be in synch with the current trends. Which are often very short lived.\n\nMy innate intuition to travel the road less travelled has always served me well. The downside is many people try to point out what a mistake that is. I've learned that I'm not obligated to anyone to defend my position.\n\nQuote\nLong-term focus: You mentioned \"We're very patient\"--basically that when the time is right & pain crossed a threshold, people become your customers, and then stick with you, refer you, etc.\n/Quote\n\nRegarding the above.

Where customers can send me names of family and friends to send brochures to.\n\nThey stay on my database. For future reference.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I received an order from that friend. For 6 Fitz Like A Glove\u2122 Ironing Board Cover packages. That's AUD$448.05. With an accompanying note telling me that in 2016, she was shocked/horrified/astounded (her words) at how expensive a Fitz Like A Glove\u2122 Ironing Board Cover package was. But. After burning through $$$$ in cheap covers over 3 years. And the attendant irritation that comes with these poorly fitting covers. She crossed the threshold where quality matters. She made a purchase for her children. Her mother. Her mother-in-law. And of course, herself.\n\nNot everyone believes in being patient. But it's an unsung virtue. It's a given that time and experience changes opinions. \n\nIf ever I can help you, please let me know.

Seems like a difficult decision to sell your beloved rural property in NSW.Click to expand...\n\nG'day @MTF,\n\nThank you for asking!\n\nThere were many factors in play.\n\nOne was that my partner, Victor Pleshev, is an architect. And has always wanted us to live in a home that he designed. Up until now, we've always purchased properties with a house on them. And renovated them.\n\nHe was hankering for the opportunity to design a home from scratch. To suit us.\n\nHe started talking about this in 2014. And I was very resistant. Because we both loved our rural property. And had invested 20 years in developing the showpiece garden. And Meadow House. Which he designed for his mother. We also spent a considerable amount of time improving the 54 hectares (135 acres).\n\nWhen his mother died in 2014, he thought it was the perfect time to make a clean break. And find another property. Which would be smaller.\n\nI didn't warm to the idea at all.\n\nSo Meadow House became a guest house on our property.\n\nBut. As time passes. Opinions change.\n\nI could see that Victor was unhappy about not having the opportunity to live his dream. Which is to design and build a house that we'll love living in.\n\nStanding outside. Looking in. It was apparent that I've had my dream come true. Which is to own my own business. And work and live from a beautiful rural property.\n\nAnd it was unconscionably selfish on my part to not allow Victor to have his dream come true.\n\nUntil September of 2018, we were in severe drought. Down to bare earth. The heavens opened. And the rains poured down for a month. We had almost our yearly rainfall in one month.\n\nWe went from living in the desert of Saudi Arabia. To living in the emerald green pastures of Ireland.\n\nVictor said this was a small window of opportunity to put the property on the market and have it sell quickly. While it looked so beautiful. He also reminded me that an El Nino was predicted for our location starting in December 2018. And once the El Nino kicked in. We would look drab and brown again.\n\nI made an instant decision that he was right. And he was.\n\nWe put the property on the market on 1st October 2018. It was shown to 5 couples. And two couples made offers on the 10th of October 2018. Within an hour of each other. We were fortunate to be able to secure full price. Which we didn't expect.\n\nWe settled on the 14th of December. And when I closed the gate for the last time at midnight. To start a new life. I blew a kiss to the property. Thanked it for all its wonderful years.\n\nBut knew that I was fully ready to join Victor on his adventure. To make his dream come true.\n\nCome December. The rain stopped. And by the time we left, the landscape was starting to turn brown again.\n\nA friend who raises Alpacas not far from where we lived says her property is now down to bare earth. And she's in a normally high rainfall area. Her property was a potato farm when she purchased it 20 years ago. Very green. And very lush.\n\nThe decision to sell was indeed difficult for me to make. But once having made the decision, I had no regrets. And have no desire to look back.\n\nOur criteria for our new location was. Cooler. Wetter. With spectacular views.\n\nWe're now in the foothills of the Victorian Alps. The temperature is on average 7C cooler than where we were. And although this area is also experiencing a drought. The landscape is still partially green. With no bare earth. Yet!\n\nWe purchased 100 acres in Swifts Creek, Victoria. A small town that in its heyday, was a gold mining town. The property is steep. And once you get to the top (which requires a 4 wheel drive) the 360 degree uninterruped views are sensational. We look down onto a small valley of farms. And the distant hills of the Victorian Alps completely surround us.\n\nWe'll be able to see the snowcaps in winter. And watch the hills change throughout the day as the shadow of the sun passes across them. It will be morning and evening mists. A constant breeze. Fully off the grid as there is no electricity. And only mobile phone coverage.\n\nWe're more remote than where we were. Shopping is now a 2-hour drive to the closest regional centre. With 40km of the 125km drive being a hairpin bend, two lane, ultra narrow country road. With no roadside barriers to stop you from driving off the side of the cliff face. But as no one speeds. We're not overly concerned.\n\nThe drive into Bairnsdale follows a river on one side. And the face of a cliff on the other side. We drive through sun filtering through the mountain treescape. And have trouble keeping our eyes on the road because the landscape is sooooo very beautiful.\n\nWhen other people our age have put their feet up and are in the departure lounge of life. (It gets earlier and earlier with each generation). We're powering through another change. Energised by the newness of everything. And back to solving more problems in a day than most people solve in a year.\n\nI'm so pleased to have made this change. It's so exciting experiencing new things. Meeting new people. Doing things in a different way.\n\nI highly recommend it.\n\nIn 2014 I had no idea I'd be where I am today. And I'm very appreciative of Victor not haranguing me about how much he wants to make a change. But letting time help me make the decision to change.\n\nWe are renting a quaint house in the town of Omeo for 12 months. Which is how long Victor estimates it will take to build on our property. We're in the centre of town. So have no real neighbours. Mainly businesses. We're an 18 minute drive from Swifts Creek. And although surrounded by other buildings. We have the privacy we crave by not having neighbours who pop in and out.\n\nIt has a big country kitchen. A gas stovetop. But no oven! I'm a baker, so I've had to improvise. I purchased a convection microwave oven. Which although small. Does allow me to bake.\n\nAnd for roasts, it's the 1970's standby that all of us in Oz had when we were renovating our terrace houses and were without kitchens for a while. Sunbeam's high top frying pan. I was searching the internet at 3am one morning. And finally found one. On eBay. The last one for sale.\n\nIt makes the most succulent roasts ever. Much better than an oven.\n\nAgain, @MTF, thank you for asking. Answering you clarifies even more for me that it was the best decision. ~Carol\u2764", "~Carol\u2764", "Thank you for sharing this story, Carol. I hope you'll enjoy your new home.

The refrigerator is the problem. Finding one that's big enough. That won't drain the battery at night. So we will probably opt for battery and diesel backup.\n\nThere are larger refrigerators for solar available in the USA. But so far Australia doesn't have large ones. Only very small ones. And as we can't shop every day for fresh food. The tyranny of distance raising its head. It's going to be a challenge. \n\nThe manufacturing is absolutely staying with our sewing company. Who have been our partners for 25 years.  'Made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability' is what opens peoples hearts to buying our products.\n\nThe downside is the time it takes for stock to arrive from NSW to Victoria. 5 working days.

The closest I've been to that area is Lakes Entrance and Marlo, of which I recommend.\n\nI should have described the mud part a little better.

I am very erudite regarding digital marketing. I've been immersed in it for many years. And spend my hard earned $$$$ to keep learning about it. More than 99.99% of other people. \n\nI also frequently attend webinars about the virtues of online advertising. Including Facebook advertising. Wanting to be convinced. I've not yet had one convince me it was worth spending my money on.\n\nPerhaps it's because I strongly believe that personal communication is more powerful than online anonymity. I'm a big user of the telephone. All my joint ventures have been put together over the phone. I ring customers regularly just to say G'day. And learn about them. Which helps my marketing. \n\nThe biggest waste of time is to constantly seek new customers. The best use of time is to cultivate my existing customers. So I can discover how I can create new customers. From my existing customers.\n\nI look for opportunities to move from online. To offline. That's where I excel. And I knock the socks off people who only depend on online conversions. \n\nI'm sure there are many people on this forum who would leap at the opportunity to get help from you. And I appreciate your offer to me. If I change my mind, I'll let you know. ~Carol\u2764Click to expand...\n\nHi Carol:\n\nI do a lot of digital marketing. And people who know me may be surprised at this, but I don't think paid advertising is a sustainable long term business model.\n\nI might have said somewhere that your business is 'different' but it's not. At all. You sell a product that solves a problem and has a unique selling proposition and high salient benefit. That's literally every business that makes it work long term.\n\nYou, on the other hand, ARE different.\n\nPaid advertising might work for your business. But it probably will not work for YOU. You don't roll that day. You care more about your customers proselytizing for you than you do about trying to acquire them with the new-fangled techniques of the 'pros'. \n\nI have a rant about digital advertising but that's for some other day. Just know that I believe that organic growth is more indicative of the health of a business than increases in ROAS or ad spend or what have you.\n\nJT", "The-J said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nHi Carol:\n\nI do a lot of digital marketing.

That's an unexpected response from a digital marketer.\n\nThank you!\n\nI've often thought about putting on my website that I don't engage in predatory marketing activities.\n\nBecause this is my experience with digital marketers and paid advertising.\n\nIn 2015 my partner and I scoured the web for new chairs for our dining room. We looked at many sites before we made our decision.\n\nIt was then that I noticed that everywhere I went on the web, there were ads on sites I was visiting. From sites that I had visited for chairs.\n\nI genuinely felt harassed. And was annoyed at being stalked.\n\nTo make matters worse, the company we purchased our chairs from stalked me relentlessly for weeks after our purchase.\n\nI had no trouble making the decision that I would reward them for their efforts by never making another purchase from them again. \n\nI then discovered AdBlocker. Which is now on every browser I use.\n\nIf I visit a site. And am blocked by the site from viewing its contents unless I turn off AdBlocker. I click off.\n\nI've also noticed recently that the New York Times. For which I have a paid subscription. Is now asking me to disable AdBlocker. Which I refuse to do.\n\nThat's why I have a paid subscription. To stop being pursued by predatory marketers.\n\nI also despise those popups from the side that tell me Joe from wherever has just purchased whatever I'm looking at. I hate them so much. I click off the site.\n\nI don't need to be bludgeoned into making a buying decision. I'm intelligent enough to know how to collect information. Assess it. And make a decision.\n\nI assume that my customers are also intelligent enough to make a buying decision. Or not. After they assess whatever it is I've provided in the way of information about my products.\n\nThe last thing I want is for someone to regret purchasing one of my products.\n\nI assume that I don't make as many sales as a snake oil salesperson. But nor do I want to. I want solid customers. Who love what they spent their hard earned cash on. And who also love the way they are treated with courtesy. Dignity. And respect. And who come back again and again. And introduce me to their family. And friends.\n\nThese are the people who send me postcards from their trips. Email me when they're sick to keep me up to date. Or to share a happy event. Or when they change addresses. Or just to drop in to say G'day.\n\nOver 26 years, this is how I've built my business to where it is today.\n\nWe are all a product of our experiences.\n\nWhen I was 13 years old, I got my first job. Working Saturdays in a department store. It's a job I kept until I left for university when I was 17.\n\nI learned a great deal about how to treat customers from that Saturday job.\n\nThat some customers are aloof. And want no help.\n\nThat others love it when a sales assistant helps them make a buying decision that they're struggling with.\n\nI also learned that no one likes to be stalked. That is. Followed around the store. And leapt upon if they pick something up to look at it.\n\nI've seen sales assistants do this. And I've seen people leave the store because of it.\n\nThis is what digital advertising is. Stalking people. And leaping on them when they pause for a moment to look at something.\n\nIn my day, these people were called pests. Today. I call them online marketing predators.\n\nI've disengaged Messenger from all my Facebook pages because I can't stand the mindless approaches made by people who know nothing about me. Asking me to buy something I'm not at all interested in.\n\nIt's refreshing to read your opinion, JT. Which isn't shared by the majority of online marketers. I'm almost always shouted down when I tell people I do no online advertising.\n\nThank you for taking the time to drop in. Say G'day. And share your opinion with me. ~Carol\u2764", "Sunni said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nWow! Wonderful thread.

The closest I've been to that area is Lakes Entrance and Marlo, of which I recommend.\n\nI should have described the mud part a little better.  I think it has more to do with so much happening but not getting a lot of those positive echoes (sales, strong interest etc.).  It will be a different story once things are thriving a bit more.  I enjoy the uncertainty of going after something new, but not for this amount of time.\n\nAs for my dreams, a family and working on a business that solves environmental issues, getting it going then moving on to the next problem. \n\nTo start with though, I am currently working on a couple of projects with my business partner which are starting to gain some interest with the right people.  So we may have a busy few months on the way, fingers crossed.  I am going to make a post about all this soon.\n\nThen for those material dreams, a rural property maybe near the Otways (Great ocean road area, I need to be near the ocean, still need to learn to surf!) with a big workshop.  I'm an Engineer and I need to use my hands, I must have a workshop.  Being able to spend time on my hobbies to make things without relying on them for income.  A Kingswood HZ, motorcycle and the freedom to fly where I want and when.  Simple? Yes, but that's how I like it.\n\nThanks again for the reply, it's great to speak to someone local who has been through it all.\n\nJoshClick to expand...\n\nG'day @JWM,\n\nLOVE your dreams! Both material. And professional.\n\nYou've identified several things that are so important to you personally. Your need to work with your hands. Have a workshop. And have hobbies that aren't connected to being a source of income.\n\nToo many people don't take the time to identify their needs. And feel frustrated and unfulfilled throughout much of their life. Because they don't really know what's missing. \n\nThey drift through life. Hoping that one day, happiness will find them. Instead. It's our obligation to identify. Find. And indulge in. The things that make us happy. And fulfilled in life.\n\nI love motorbikes. So can appreciate your enthusiasm for having one.\n\nYour freedom to fly where and when. Is part of your vision owning your own plane? Do you have a pilot's licence?\n\nA Kingswood HZ. That brings back memories. Of the late 1970's and early 1980's. They are a very big car! Parking spaces today are so small. Do they fit into one?\n\nThis is a link on Wikipedia to photos of the village Swifts Creek. Where we will be living this time next year.\n\nSwifts Creek - Wikipedia\n\nI think living along The Great Ocean Road would be as lovely as living along The Great Alpine Road. There is much about Victoria that's truly beautiful.\n\nI love staying in touch. And hope I hear from you again. ~Carol\u2764", "Carol Jones said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nGood morning from rural Australia,\n\nIn a nutshell, my partner and I design and make textile products that are simple solutions for difficult problems. We have 400,000 customers in 30 countries around the world who think our products are the best thing since sliced bread. The icing on the cake is that all our products are made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability. We are renown for our simple solutions that work. When others don't.\n\nThat's the event.\n\nThe process is this.\n\nIn 1992, my partner and I lost everything in Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating's 'recession we had to have'. We closed down two businesses. My partner's 12 year old architectural practice. My market research consultancy. We farewelled 16 loyal and supportive staff. We sold our home of 22 years. Two cars. And our personal possessions. To pay off what debt we could. And made a scheme of arrangement with our creditors to pay off the remaining debt.\n\nPoor as church mice. We left the city lights of Sydney Australia. For a rural life in a remote village with no internet access. No email. Not even call waiting. But it met our most important criteria. We could live in a farmhouse whose rent we could afford to pay. The village was heavily affected by a severe drought. And the house was not a desirable place to live. But it was our safety net.\n\nWe made a decision to find our way back by utilising simple solutions. Our skills were in design. And research. So we reinvented ourselves as designers and makers of textile products. Our first product didn't capture the hearts of the marketplace. But our second product did. We redesigned the humble ironing board cover utilising a low tech solution to make sure it was firmly anchored to an ironing board. So it never moved. Which is what makes people hate ironing.\n\nIf you make one good product. Customers want more. So we designed 6 more textile products. And today we have more than 400,000 customers in 30 countries. Without any retail distribution. And all done online today. But in the beginning, it was all mail order.\n\nWe've been down dark alleys. Wondered if we were certifiably mad to keep doing what we were doing when ironing board covers are not top of mind with most people.\n\nBut we discovered they are very top of mind with men and women who must iron.\n\nEven though the subject is not sexy, our products, and our story, have been written about in every major publication in Australia.\n\nWe've been featured on mainstream TV. Interviewed on radio. Included in two books. The latest being 'Hunch' by international best selling author Bernadette Jiwa. I'm the 'Ironing Whisperer' on page 73.\n\nThe process of working every day is what got us to where we are today.\n\nWe did what everyone said we couldn't do. We built a worldwide business from broke. On a remote rural property. Before the internet and email came to our rural village.\n\nI'm here to mix with like minded men and women. I have 35 years of business experience to share. I've done the hard yards. And would love to be of help to those of you who can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAnd. I want to travel further along the road to wealth.\n\nIt will be a pleasure to meet you. ~CarolClick to expand...\n\nReally amazing!\n\nYou turned adversity into prosperity.\n\nHow do you handle competition?\n\nGenerally everyone is copying idea.\n\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk", "Tanu1234 said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nReally amazing!\n\nYou turned adversity into prosperity.\n\nHow do you handle competition?\n\nGenerally everyone is copying idea.\n\n\nSent from my iPhone using TapatalkClick to expand...\n\nGood morning @Tanu1234 from Oz,\n\nThank you for your very kind words.\n\nHow do we handle competition?\n\nWhen I key in the search term ironing board cover/s into Google Australia, I'm told there are 19 million results that answer to the search term.\n\nI have always operated in a very intensely competitive marketplace.

And never hears from me again except to ask them to buy again.\n\nFrom the first sales I made in 1994 for my Fitz Like A Glove\u2122 Ironing Board Cover.

Because of the time it takes to train a person with a disability to do one task well. And only one task. \n\nThere are about 14 different men and women who have a disability who work on our products. Each person doing only one task. And then handing it over to the next person who's trained to do the next task. \n\nWe also have the slogan \"Made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability\" locked up tight. \n\nOur story - with our slogan - has been written about in every major publication in Australia.

I think you have already shifted your thinking to a \"Problem Solver\", which is my goal too. \n\nCurrently, I'm in IT, I was very lucky I was granted a PR and I'm now saving as much as I can to restart my dream (after the big mess I did with my hard earned cash while I was in my native country - poor investment decisions). I also sell some things in Amazon, we have to start somewhere, learning the ropes on how to sell to an audience.

Have a good one.Click to expand...\n\nG'day again @LinorCG,\n\nWe all make bad decisions. And we all lose money. \n\nIt's more tragic when that happens when you don't have any money to lose.\n\nWhen Kerry Packer was Austalia's wealthiest man. And our first billionaire. He was an intrepid gambler.  He lost more at the gaming tables than he won. But he was so rich, it didn't matter.\n\nHe also made bad business decisions. Lost money. But never enough to put a dent into his enormous wealth. Until James invested in One-Tel. And lost half the Packer fortune.\n\nI'm not a fan of starting a business on Amazon.  For two reasons. \n\nYou're using a mogul's real estate. Who can change the rules at any time to suit his own purposes. Without any thought as to how it affects you.\n\nAnd because of the shoddy way staff are treated. I care about that.\n\nOn the other hand.\n\nI agree with you. We all have to start somewhere. And honing your skills relating to how to sell to an audience is very forward thinking. Obviously, Amazon is not the end game. But the start. When all the chess pieces are still on the board.\n\nA personal G'day will always be welcome. And best wishes on the road to more experience. Learning is one of the most exciting parts of being in business. ~Carol\u2764"], "Page12": ["VIVEKSINGHJADONS said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nYour story is truly inspiring.

But it wasn't a career choice for a gal like me when I was starting out in my adult life.\n\nMy thoughts when we knew ironing board covers could be a business?\n\nI thought: \"How bizarre that people could care about something as mundane as an ironing board cover fitting on their board properly.\"\n\nWe were as amazed as everyone who constantly asks us in disbelief. How can we make a living out of ironing board covers?\n\nThis wasn't the market niche we had envisaged when we reinvented ourselves. We were aiming for something more glamourous. More trendy. Sexier. Something off the wall we could write home about. All the things we all hope our business will be. Because that's what attracts publicity. Word of mouth. Et al.\n\nBut. When we listened to the people who were clamouring for our ironing board cover. We realised it would be a BIG mistake to ditch this product in favour of something very pie in the sky. \n\nWe were dirt poor after losing everything in Australia's 1992 'recession we had to have'. Bills needed to be paid. And here were people throwing money at us for something they valued. \n\nIt would have been irresponsible of us not to pursue this need in the marketplace. And fill it.\n\nThis product was a true light bulb moment for us.  I don't know how often it happens to other people. But the recognition that we had designed and developed something that was truly wanted by other people is truly electrifying. \n\nEvery week I have people who purchased a cover years ago ring and tell me how happy they are that we're still in business. That in itself makes what we do very rewarding.\n\nBecause of our story. And how we developed our product. And how we chose to have it made with love and care in rural Australia by men and women who have a disability. We have been able to attract the publicity every business craves.\n\nDecisions made early in our business life centred around us being a caring company. It's how we want to be known. And all decisions made since then are influenced by that desire. \n\nFrom the feedback we receive from customers. And what's written about us. We know that we're faithful to our ideology.\n\nI hope I've answered your question @Vangoue. \n\nFinding your niche is sometimes not easy. But perhaps you'll be lucky like us. It will just jump out in front of you.\n\nWelcome to The Fastlane Forum. It's a privilege to meet you. And I hope you find your path sooner.

We need to keep in closer contact.....\n\n@Chadi: LOVED the technology hack talk. We've already started implementing them. Thanks!\n\n@Sean Marshall: Yet another example of a \"No Excuses\" lifestyle. Thank you.\n\nEDIT: How could I forget @throttleforward !!? Bro! You'd better be franchising by next year!", "As far as global thoughts on the meetup:\n\n\nThere just ISN'T ENOUGH TIME. SERIOUSLY. I could have spent hours with just about everyone but it wasn't physically possible.\nWhat I took from this meeting was significantly different than what I took from last year's (my first). Yet it was still incredibly valuable. Over and over again I was reminded of my post in the \"MJ is giving out free Mentoring\" thread: You wouldn't even know what to DO with the information yet.\nThis year I was able to have conversations with @JasonR and others and actually understand and formulate a strategy to DO. Last year...I was kind of lost with the higher level stuff.\nThis year I lost my FEAR: That is, the Wife and I are mentally in a place to  TAKE ADVANTAGE of the advice/mentoring that we received from the last meetup.\n\nI can't imagine the Meetup getting any bigger. As it was, there were whole BLOCKS of people that I wanted to spend time with, but didn't have time to.\nTalking Stick was pretty cool. Bummer that the Pool was closed\nAlso, gambling addiction is a THING. UGH.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFolks, what I said at the meetup was true: You're on a high right now and it'll last about thirty days.\n\nThen.....nothing. You HAVE to, TODAY (!)\n\n- put into place a PLAN, SYSTEMS, and SITUATION (five closest people, living conditions, etc) to set yourself up for success. Don't be wallowing in a sea of Self Loathing come April or May.\n\n- Do it Now! Stick with it.\n\n- Get 2-4 others that you connected with, make a small accountability/MM group (use SLACK. Forget Skype for anything other than video chats) and get moving. Allow them to kick your a$$. You kick their asses. Be helpful. Maybe you'll become friends. \n\n- Destroy or get rid of: the TV, the XBox/PS4\n\n- Consider OUTSOURCING the stuff that you're not good at (painful lesson for me): Graphic arts, Photoshop, product photos (maybe), Website design, etc.\n\n- FOCUS on what you are/or should be good at: Biz plan, copywriting, strategic and tactical planning/execution for the business.\n\n- Workout, have fun, hike/bike, travel. It's not ALL grinding.\n\nBe ready to come back a year from now and talk about what you've done. Imagine how embarrassed you'll be if you sorta gave up. \n\nThe struggle is real. Life is real. Shit happens. But it's what we do when shit hits the fan that defines us. In business, in life, and in relationships.\n\nPeace", "To echo what's already been said, phenomenal job of putting on the event by @MJ DeMarco, @AllenCrawley , and @Red.\n\nI don't normally go to events like this (the last one was a Dan Kennedy event about 7-8 years ago and almost every presentation was a sales pitch for a backend product), but this event was NOTHING like that.  It was pure gold in every presentation.\n\nI am back home now sifting through my 40 pages of handwritten notes to put together a prioritized Execution list.\n\nI enjoyed meeting everyone I did, especially @Eskil , @Travis Phipps , @Vigilante , @throttleforward , @MustImprove , @Arrabista and many, many more.  And there are many more I never got the opportunity to speak to but will next year.\n\nThis event gave me a long to do-list for my current business, as well as ideas for new ones.  Most importantly, it crystallized and clarified my thinking in a few areas that I now realize I have been holding myself back. \n\nOne last thing to echo what was said about cold calling at the end in the panel.  Although I agree with @MJ DeMarco that \"cold calling sucks\", it is definitely something that needs to be tried in your business as it's always worked extremely well in mine (B2B reaching Directors, VP & C-level).  But if your perception of cold calling is to make a sale cold to a cold prospect on the phone, it can be brutal.\n\nHowever, cold calling does indeed work well if you:\n\na) have a very well thought out and researched list of prospects who already are clients of your type of service but currently use a competitor\nb) the value of each sale is high - anything in the mid to high 4 figures and up is excellent for this.\nc) you use the cold call as the 1st step of a multi-step process - ie you call to get a face to face appointment, NOT to make a sale \n\nLastly, someone mention the book Predictable Revenue.  Excellent book, however if you are trying to sell in Canada using this method, be very careful with the CASL (Canadian Anti-SPAM) legislation that went into effect July 1, 2014 as it prohibits this practice with severe penalties.  I reached out to the author Aaron Ross on this 2 years ago and he wasn't totally sure and agreed that there were a lot of grey areas with it.\n\nAmazing job by all presenters and I will definitely be back next year.", "What a weekend!!!\n\nSo happy I got to meet nearly everyone there. I think there were a few that escaped me. Intentional? \n\nIf it wasn't for @Red these events wouldn't go so smoothly. From the planning, the scheduling and her bull dogged tenacity and ability to Get Sh!t Done. (After hearing her presentation it's no wonder.)\n\nShout out to @BaraQueenbee for keeping me caffeinated. You did a fantastic job running the Bulletproof Coffee station and I'm so happy to have meet you. Thank you @Eskil for helping us to identify each other quickly with just a glance. Thank you @thorn for creating the eye pleasing itinerary.\n\nI'd like to personally thank a few people that took the time over the weekend to help enrich my business by either sharing their contacts, talents, insights, advice, expertise or audience.

Certainly none of this would have happened without you guys first.  \n\n@MJ DeMarco looking forward to the new book.", "Thanks to everyone who helped put on this event! Even better than last years IMO. \n\nThe awesome thing about the Summit is hearing people's stories, coming back the next year and seeing how far they've come and what progressed. \n\nOne of my big inspirations this year was @Boom.

The great speakers, the camaraderie, the intoxicating energy of the venue, it was truly an event I will remember forever -- and look forward to next year.\n\nEven as the event grew larger this year (about 60% larger over last) there was still an incredible bond between the group.  The side conversations, the fireside chats, the cigar pit stories; as I rolled out of the casino and climbed into my car, I felt like I was saying leaving a family behind.\n\nA huge, special thanks to @Red for making this happen -- because of her, we got to rock this event in a venue teeming with activity, energy, and activities.  Just several years ago this thing was held in a decrepit Days Inn.  On top of this, her presentation was a invaluable exercise into how to get things done with the event itself exemplifying it successful execution.  \n\nAdditional thanks go to @AllenCrawley who seriously might have a second career in emceeing.  Thank you for taking the reigns of the summit itself and keeping it on pace.\n\nAnother thank you to @BaraQueenbee for queening the coffee station, @Kreedos Phoenix for keeping out the lookie-loos at Top Golf (ha ha) and @Eskil for the badges, the checking process, and a lot of administrative work that I can guarantee, isn't much fun, especially when you have a company to run.\n\nAnd finally, a big fat thanks to everyone who spoke and gave us the pleasure of hearing your story as well as special insights into your experience and expertise!!\n\nTHESE GOOD FOLKS MADE IT HAPPEN!\n\nGoing forward, I have made a list of things that could be improved (physical itineraries, handheld microphone, some food changes, speaker who blew us off, etc.) as we will definitely push to repeat this event at TSR!\n\nAs promised, I will be posting my original topic on the INSIDER forum some time this week or next.  I will also post the SLIDES and a summation of my topic there as well.\n\nAlso, I will be creating a SUBGROUP (Summit Attendee) which will signify you attended the summit -- such will give you special access to a private forum I will create which will be for attendees only.

I don't  know yet but I hope to be able to talk about some success at next year's summit.\n\nIt was a great event for sure; not just for the sessions but for the people. Many thanks have already been posted to all the speakers and I'd like to echo those thanks once again. \n\nI was expecting to be able to put faces with forum names and maybe learn about others businesses with some superficial depth. But I wasn't expecting what unfolded. I have been surprised by the depth of the relationships formed and that businesses were discussed. From posts by @BaraQueenbee, @MJ DeMarco and others I see that I'm not alone in the connectedness that was felt. It first started with @JonnyC and @NYCGoblin at the airport and didn't let up.  \n\nBefore I left I challenged @throttleforward to post an INE of his own as he pursues his current path. I look forward to his post and to hear his update next year. He in turn challenged me to exercise one of his suggestions about giving free marketing advice to someone 'cold'. I'm not a digital marketer but I may be at some point in the distant future, so challenge accepted! \n\n@Boom I just finished listening to your CDs as I wait for my flight. Thank you for this gift. I don't yet know if expanding my REI is my preferred path but you've given me a lot to consider and apply a Canadian perspective to.\n\nI look forward to kicking the asses off some of you over [HASHTAG]#slack[/HASHTAG] soon.

I never would have believed that was possible.\n\nAll of the speakers were incredible and gave me so much.  I took away too many value nuggets, that I haven't even processed them yet.\n\nThe best part of these events is building the personal relationships.  I spend a lot of time in front of my computer, or on client calls/visits.  I don't get to meet like minded individuals who can help me blow my business up, with just a few words of advice.\n\nI would like to do a longer follow up post, where I list some of the specifics that helped me...from each speaker and from each conversation (this will be a daunting task, but it might be fun).\n\nLet me tell you a \"True Story\".  This event in 2015 was largely responsible for a HUGE boost in my business last year.  When I say HUGE, I mean think 100% growth.  I can't attribute all of that growth to the meetup, but it may very well be responsible for 75% of that growth.  I'm a numbers guy and an objective guy...so, I had to throw that out there.  Because I believe that a lot of people see these events as a good for \"networking\" or getting some good \"advice\" or \"inspiration\".  Don't get me wrong...it is awesome for those things, but if you implement just one or two things you pick up this conference...it can be life changing...\n\nThere aren't enough like buttons, or shout-outs I can give.

What are the odds?  This weekend was full of many \"coincidences\" like that.  In Omni, I gained a credible contact and I hope I can give even half as much value as he provided on that walk.  Thank you!\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSO many others I'm connecting or got to connect with but I dont want to write a long dedication as I'm on grind mode!\n\nPeace!\nFreed", "Simply a fantastic experience. Now I really understand what people meant when they said they could not afford not to attend!\n\nThe importance of taking action post-conference has already been mentioned here. I would also recommend everybody to set aside an hour or two to go over notes and reflect before taking action. Information overload and eagerness to do everything is a consequence of massive value provided by the presenters. Identify what is the most important thing(s) that you can use right now to propel your business, and systematize the rest for later use.\n\nI have been using a somewhat tweaked version of the GTD system for a while, and spent my 5 hour plane ride back to FL to reflect and categorize action steps and notes into 1) urgents (things that will have an immediate impact on my business), 2) someday (important tasks when I have more time available), and 3) reference material (information that will be useful to implement at a later stage). \n\nA big thanks to all the speakers and to the amazing crew that put all of this together.

I for one have already recommended Homewyse.com (thanks to @Boom ) to a friend looking to install a patio structure.  I've also been inspired to begin using Fiverr again for things that may seem quick and easy to do myself but could end up taking hours or days if I end up going down that rabbit hole.  Those are obviously small things that don't immediately impact me or my business, but they've given me that first step in taking something new and implementing it in my life.\n\nHere's an interesting little video that shows the power that one small initial step can have in taking on something much bigger:", "million$$$smile said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nMan, I REALLY screwed up not going.\nSometimes we pick the wrong business priorities.\n\nBad Call This Time...\n\nThanks for giving me a good swift kick in the a$$ for not rising above my own playbox.Click to expand...\n\nI'm sorry you couldn't make it as well.

Don't dabble (credit @LightHouse I believe). Go into a market full throttle with full intent on making it work and making a big splash.\n-It's generally better to enter a market that has competition because competition means demand, then it's a matter of taking a portion of that market. My biggest mistakes in the past have been entering into small demand areas with little to no competition. Start with the need! The need comes first!\n-The ones who put in the most effort are the one's who will be the most successful. Most people are looking for the shortcut. The obstacle is the opportunity.\n-The more value you offer the customer (and showing it in your marketing and product copy), the more your product will seem like the correct choice over other products.\n-When accomplishing a goal or task requires the cooperation of a company, start with the people who can say yes. Gatekeepers are trained to say \"no\".\n\nI will leave you with this...", "Wow.

From affiliate marketing struggles to software development and arbitrage success, your story has been crazy and I hope I can continue to help you this year as you continue to progress.\n\n@biophase Your talk had the most impact on me.  There were so many golden nuggets: experience life to find problems; research the shit out of your competitors; embrace the barriers to entry; give consistent, constant effort.  I can\u2019t thank you enough for the perspective.\n\n@Envision Your presentation was incredible.  Like so many other talks, you made me realize how even when I was running myself into the ground overworking myself, I wasn\u2019t hustling.  You define the hustle, have found ways to build an incredible network and take on life without letting anything hold you back.  Even though I am over 11 years your senior, I have so much to learn from you.\n\n@Kung Fu Steve  It was incredibly awesome and inspirational to hear you speak and finally meet you.  The world of self-help is flooded with bullshit artists, but you\u2019re not one of them and it\u2019s really refreshing.\n\n@kamanuci & @GIlman - Thanks a ton for shedding even more light on how to hire people to get the job done right.  My hiring efforts in the past have been lukewarm at best, and you made me see the dozens of ways that I was the problem and can hire better.  That\u2019s my first priority this year.\n\n@GIlman - Special shoutout to you as we share a common thread in software.  Seeing another software guy in this group who has an amazing plan, an amazing background and an amazing business model has been truly inspirational \u2013 even more this year than last year.\n\n@thorn - Thanks a ton for sharing your story with me on the first day.  Your story has really opened my eyes to the opportunities the hustle can bring, the importance of never being satisfied and how to ensure you have passion in your business.\n\n@throttleforward - In Alexandria you told me you were embarrassed to present about your \u201clittle bullshit company\u201d (or something similar), but your story is incredibly inspiring. Your ability to do this while having a demanding full time job, doing consulting and taking care of your family shows me how much more I am capable of, too.\n\n@Arrabista - I can\u2019t believe I only met you twice.  Thank you for making my wife and I feel incredibly welcome and at home in the tribe.  It\u2019s always inspirational to hear your adventures through the year, and the business opportunities you\u2019re pursuing.\n\n@Vigilante - Your perspectives on crafting business deals and balancing all of the variables at once was enlightening.  The fear of non-delivery is still strong with me, despite how hard I work to overcome it. You\u2019ve made me realize it\u2019s a fear worth overcoming.\n\n@Boom - Thanks for sharing your story, struggle, and journey.  It was eye opening that no matter where you come from, no matter what shit we go through, success is there if we decide to choose it.\n\n@Sean Marshall  - The journey you and your wife have gone through is similar to ours, and you\u2019ve given me a new way to think about living life to the fullest as an entrepreneur with a family.  It\u2019s a lesson for which I am truly grateful.\n\n@JonnyC - Your story was like hearing a case study of the amazing advice @biophase laid out in his talk.  It\u2019s incredible what you\u2019ve done so far, and I am glad we were able to have a chance meeting so that I could hear your story just before you left.\n\nI still haven\u2019t thanked everyone who had a huge impact on me this year.

I didn't get a chance to thank you and talk to you as much as I'd like to. But it meant a lot and it lit a fire inside me. Thank you.\n\nI feel like this whole event unlocked a part of my brain, that was me holding myself back. Some bullshit beliefs I created a long time ago still lingered in my head before and now their gone. \n\nI'll see you all again soon!\n\n\"Don't dabble, don't F*ck around. Just work and execute.\"", "Well I can't add too much to what has been said other than it is all true. It is very hard for me to get away (business/family) but thanks to a great spouse was able to make it. It was an incredible event. \n\nOne major great thing about this event that cannot be stressed enough is that MJ does not desire to be a guru. If anyone has ever attended real estate/personal development events you know that even if you feel like you are getting value the event serves primarily to upsell something to you. Free event/$1000 event/10,000 event/40,000event. I have attended a few 1000 dollar events for real estate because I absolutely love real estate and while I learned a few things it was nothing like the fastlane summit.

I\u2019ll help drum that up if you need me too]\n\n\n[USER=8814]@AnneC[/USER]  @ john @ kevin - I love seeing you guys all the time, every time i see you it is seriously like seeing distant family. I wish i had had more time to chat with you guys, but we will get together somewhere later this year. I owe it to you @Anne for telling me to step up last year. That drove me most of the year to have something to talk about this year.\n\n\n@Eskil  - I know we talk often but thank you for the advice on the plastic injection molding and letting everyone get a deep dive into your process. It is invaluable to me as well as many others to me able to see the side of things that you don\u2019t get to normally. I have a ton of notes from your Preso i still have to re-review as well\n\n\n@irishmickk  - Mike you amaze me with what you\u2019ve built, captivating an entire market in a country is no easy feat esp with your products. I will follow up with you here soon to see how i can help accelerate your process. I can see you being on the speaker list next year, without contest. Thanks for making the leap over the pond so we could all meet you!\n\n\n@theferrariboy  -  I know we didn\u2019t get much time to chat, but we will in april. See you at Wavedaze, start saving your change now, or plan to sell that car cause you are going to want a $40k 250 lb toy after that.\n\n\n@EvanOkanagan -  It was great seeing you again. Loved hearing the story about your events last year. Glad i got to expand on the last memory i had of you lifting people up at the bar for sport. You are going to crush it as Partner for your firm.\n\n\n@Milkanic -  Great seeing you again as always, we never get enough time to put our technical knowledge together but that might be a good thing! I hope you have your breakout year this year.\n\n\n@Envision (roc) -  I think you inspired a lot of people this year Roc. You are the only eprson I know that has literally 0 excuse not to me worth millions in a few short years. You know what you need to do, get to work and don\u2019t stop. You\u2019ve accomplished far more than most in such a short time, so go get the rest of it. I know you can do it!\n\n\n@1step - As always it was good hanging out, I know we chat often. I didn\u2019t get to thank you for getting my project last year jump started. You were a huge help in that and I owe you a ton of gratitude. Can wait to see how this year goes for you since you are going to 2x. (and yes, some of us extroverts need breaks too )\n\n\n@Hong King Kong  - [HASHTAG]#Wedemboyz[/HASHTAG] - You are getting ready to crush everyone with the end of your KS campaign, yet you still got time for us little guys doing weird dances at the multi-cultrual club. You are awesome dude, can\u2019t wait to see what this year brings for you!\n\n\n@OperationMyWay - Kyle it sucks we didn\u2019t get much time together this year, we will catch up soon though, this is your year to jump in both feet forward. I am there as a resource if you need me, you know that!\n\n\n@Kreedos Phoenix - It was great meeting you and your girl. She is hilarious but i still want to know what she meant by \u201cya\u2019ll aint from around here!\u201d  You guys are hilarious!\n\n\n@BaraQueenbee - I am surprised at your drive and your charisma. Thanks for keeping all our frineds and family caffineted, im sorry we didn\u2019t get to chat more, i told you it\u2019d be second best \n\n\n\n@Morethan1 (alex) - Alex thanks for your offer for help on some of the plastic stuff i need to know, as soon as i start settling I will reach out to you. I never thought i could chat with someone as smart as you!\n\n\n@Jamie T - I am glad you came and i\u2019m glad i had the chance to meet you. But more than anything, thanks for bringing house coffee when we needed it most. It shows huge character thinking about everyone around you. I cant wait to learn more about your story!\n\n\n@SK2kev - You and your partner are rock solid dudes, i told someone i regretted not having more time to talk with you guys. I feel like we could all hang out at a bar for hours on end. I hope to learn more about ya\u2019lls business over the next year and provide help if i can.\n\n\n@MacApple (jay) - I hope all those trays got picked up and you have a new direction now. You and your wife are awesome. I\u2019m disappointed im not the best looking dude in the room anymore, some say that stopped a long time ago but i think it was just until this year  You are set to do some great things this year dude!\n\n\n@GIlman - We have still avoided spending some serious chat time together, I loved your preso this year. I took a ton of notes i still have yet to analyze, i hope to do that soon and implement your vast array of knowledge.\n\n\n@exclusives88 (Mike) - It was great meeting you, the new watches look awesome. I\u2019ll be ordering one sometime soon to add to my collection. Let me know when you get back in our area so we can meet up!\n\n\n@MikeC - No amazing intros this year, but no wrecking house with terrible lines either. Keep being MikeC and I will keep anticipating what\u2019s next.\n\n\n@danoodle - I am glad to say there were no midgets or bronies this year. Your new baby is beautiful and I think it\u2019s made you a better man. I am glad you\u2019ve come and grown with us every year.\n\n\n@Iwokeup  - Pete, im so excited to see this new product line explode, i think you are primed and this weekend ignited your fire. You have my info if you need help, just hit green!\n\n\n@Sauce  - My chat with you was actually the most notable discussion i had all weekend. The fact that you were vulnerable and transparent to someone you didn't know says huge things about your character. I hope the feedback you didn\u2019t ask for (lol) was beneficial. If you need to talk, msg me!\n\n\n@Chitown  - My dude, you are on a breakout this year. You are the most likable charismatic dude i know. After i chat with you I feel like i have a lot more i could be doing making others feel amazing, much the same way you do. Keep in touch this year, don\u2019t F*ck that up! \n\n\n@K.Y.  - You know you inspire  me like crazy. One of the biggest take aways i had this weekend is how present you and byron were during Monday night dinner. crush it this year.\n\n\n@saigon  (byron) - As i said above, you taught me something about being ultra present when you are with people. I love that and i am working to improve. I think you are going to make big waves this year, and I am here if you need help along the way.\n\n\n@csalvato  - I am glad you had the opportunity open up to come. It was great to finally meet Serena and Mia. Your daughter is absolutely gorgeous. You are making me re-think never taking vacations too, I might have to change that this year!\n\n\nFamily\n\n\n@throttleforward  - dude, I can\u2019t explain to you how impressed I am with you and your preso this year. I\u2019ve watched you build this biz and seen the struggle. To finally get validation, get the fire lit and then on top throw out the job and everything\u2026 I am so enamoured with everything you are doing. Truly truly impressive Adam, I am glad i get to see it all first hand.\n\n\n@Likwid24 - \u201cI got thesee cheezbouygas\u201d I am so glad you made it out this year. I am sure Boris has a great time massaging your legs while you were sick on Sunday too. I can\u2019t wait to see the things you and Likwid accomplish. I\u2019ll be there if you need me!\n\n\n@biophase  - I know we didn\u2019t get a ton of time to chat this year in person but thanks for all the guidance you have given me. It\u2019s always inspiring learning from KSB\u2026 i just wish KSB knew more about KSB so KSB could be taught.\n\n\n@Vigilante  - I am so glad you made it this year, i didn\u2019t know you were such a big eminem fan, i thought you lost those CD\u2019s along with your truck  I think the fire you have in you is inspiring a lot of people including me right now. Thanks for taking my call early last year, you set me on a whole new path!\n\n\n@TheTruth  - Boris, I love you bro. Although i\u2019m sliding on your moral compass, i truly appreciate you in my life. The story of you shedding everything has made me re-think a lot of things and how i operate. I hope we have more chances to actually get together this year outside of whatsapp\n\n\n@JasonR  - Words can\u2019t express my gratitude for you this year. Not only do you care about the things that are core to me, but you were there when i needed you so many times in a short period. I wish i travelled as much as you do and we could have more weekends like that. I think you are going to double up in the next few months and crush it, you know i\u2019ll be there to help where I can.\n\n\n@GlobalWealth  - Looking beyond my endless bouts of jokes to your demise, you showed me a level of friendship this year that most will never achieve. I really appreciate your drive and care for what happens in my life and how it affects everything. Even at times when i\u2019ve been defensive, know I am still thinking about it days later and working on applying it. Thank you so much for caring. ( i almost choked writing that, but it certainly wasn\u2019t because of you\u2026. sigh)\n\n\n@Kung Fu Steve  - My main man. Not many people say they have a Personal development coach in their life, none the less on tap when needed most. The things that you taught me this weekend both personal and professional were monumental to me. It\u2019s things that are already having change and will having lasting change for the rest of my life. Not just on me, but also everyone around me. Your story is truley amazing and I am really grateful to be apart  of it.\n\n\nI had conversations with a lot of you that i can\u2019t quite put a forum name too. I was hoping to connect with more folks this year but getting sick on sunday crushed all of that. I think this years group was amazing and the entire event was life changing as it always is. I love all my new friends.\n\nParting note...

Overall, there will probably be 100 tickets to spread + 20 speakers.\n\nWe will also NOT be releasing tickets like before just to anyone who wants them.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause this is a FORUM EVENT.\n\nIf you are NOT at the forum other than once a year to take a ticket away from someone who is here regularly, that strategy might have worked in the past -- but it won't next year.

This event has ABSOLUTELY CHANGED MY LIFE! It's been just a short while, and I have actually been away with my normal job for most of my time back, I have actually only had about 5 days since the event where I had time to work on my own stuff. In that time I have (in no particular order)\n\nTalked with a manufacturing specialist about having a product made in Canada. Currently in the works finding out the next steps such as having a 3D model done up, 3D printing, what I need to do before having tools made...\nBuilt a prototype for something I have had on my mind for over a year\nGot stacks of information regarding some of this Oil and Gas gibberish I was spouting to a few people at the event. I've been trying to get this information for over a year and always been too scared to actually do it, mindset shift after the event MADE me go out and get it, in less than a week!\nDuring this time I have also been laid out by a horrible illness. Got some crazy fever on my way home from the event. I still have a horrible cough and am having trouble sleeping so productivity has been very low compared to what it should have been. Even with that this has literally been the most productive 2 weeks OF MY LIFE.\n\nI have always \"known\" what I need to do to succeed, but I always just floundered about and *dabbled*. Now I freaking KNOW what I need to be doing, and I am going out there and TAKING IT!! Nothing was stopping me before but myself, and that is gone now. I feel like a juggernaut and it's amazingly inspiring. I feel powerful beyond belief. 100% of this was from attending the event and bringing about this shift.\n\nSo if you are on the fence about going and are making some BS excuses, STOP IT!!! Get off your a$$ and do something!!! Get out of your own way and let it happen.\n\n@Kung Fu Steve made me pick a number and shout \"YES\" a bunch of times. I was scared of that number. Now that number is scared of me. I feel silly when I look at it now because it is so small.

I was afraid of titles and \"wasting\" peoples time. @Eskil blew my mind when someone asked him what he knew about manufacturing before he started his product. His answer? He knew zero about it. From zero to having an amazing, functioning product that is selling.\n\nAbout a week ago I got on the phone with someone I knew who has experience bringing manufacturing to North America for large companies. He put me in contact with a guy he knows who does prototyping for people and has access to a 3D printer. I talked with him 3 days ago and finished up will a follow up email. He replied and got me in touch with someone who can do the 3D design and metal fabrication. I found out through the reply email that he is the VP of Business development for a large company, I had no idea prior to his return email.\n\nJust about an hour ago I got off the phone with the guy he got me in contact with. I drew up some sketches on engineering paper and I am now going to pass them on to the metal fabricator/3D designer. He said he will get back to me sometime tomorrow with what we need to do. Realistically I might have a 100% custom designed physical product in my hand by next week.\n\nOh, and the best part. I am in the middle of nowhere, 600 miles north of where I live, working my normal job. I put in 13 hours a day at that, and then about 5 a night on my own stuff. I have never felt more energetic!

Once upon a time \u2013 as late as 2008, in fact - the world had almost 1.3 billion landlines...\n\nPeople love to communicate, if they can. Telecoms companies love to profit from people communicating, if they can. They\u2019ll lay cables anywhere in the world, if they think they can make money out of it.\n\nSo, with some seven billion people on the planet, the vast majority of whom, one assumes, are not hermits and like communicating, you might expect that 1.3 billion figure to have been higher. Along comes the mobile phone and the point is proved. There are now 6.3 billion users in a global population of 6.9 billion people. More people have a mobile phone than have a toilet, a recent UN study showed.\n\nOf course, the superior technology of the cell phone is such that broader coverage is considerably cheaper than it is with the landline. But there is something else, something that enabled the cell phone to succeed where the landline failed.\n\n\nImage from gettyimages\nIt is what economists call \u2018financial inclusion\u2019.\n\nQuite simply, many people couldn\u2019t get access to the basic financial services needed to get a landline. Landlines were, except for pay-phones, credit-based. You needed a bank account. Many people might have liked a landline, but couldn\u2019t. The financial system actually prevented them. The telecoms companies concluded that the demand was not there, they did not put in the infrastructure and people were held back by their inability to communicate.\n\n\n\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\nBut with the cell phone, you don\u2019t need a bank account. You can buy the credit you need with cash. There are not the same barriers to entry. Anyone can get one \u2013 and they have.\n\nHow Bitcoin could enable 3.5 billion financially excluded people to participate in world trade\n\nIt is estimated that half of all adults worldwide do not have access to basic financial services. According to the World Bank, the reasons for this are \"poverty, the cost, the travel distance and the necessary paperwork to open an account.\"\n\nOnly two billion people are \u2018banked\u2019 and participate in ecommerce. Yet about 5.5 billion have at least some access to the internet. That\u2019s a potential 3.5 billion people who could participate in ecommerce but don\u2019t, because they don\u2019t have access to the necessary financial infrastructure.\n\nThanks to Bitcoin and other forms of mobile money, this lack of basic financial services is no longer a barrier to entry. You don\u2019t need a bank account or any of that stuff. That\u2019s history. All you need to participate in ecommerce is some internet access. Most of the world\u2019s population will have that long before they have proper sanitation, education or healthcare.\n\nIt is estimated that half of all adults worldwide do not have access to basic financial services.\n\nAnd the developed world will have a potential 3.5 billion new people to outsource jobs to, to sell products to and to receive products from. That is a lot of new trade. In fact, the money that the unbanked 3.5 billion make from ecommerce might enable them to buy the sanitation, education and healthcare they have been so deprived of and escape the poverty that has so blighted them.\n\nIt\u2019s rather like the Industrial Revolution enabling workers to escape rural poverty, and, within a generation, become part of a new, emerging educated middle class. We can already see this process happening in Africa.\n\nHow mobile money has turned Kenya into Africa\u2019s tech hub\n\nIt began in Kenya in the early 2000s with the M-Pesa. M stands for mobile. Pesa is Swahili for money \u2013 so you have \u2018mobile money\u2019. People started transferring their mobile phone minutes \u2013 their airtime credits \u2013 to friends or family. This airtime, of course, has a definite value. Based on a \u2018real thing\u2019 it would become a modern day commodity currency. You can now send airtime, M-Pesas, by SMS.\n\nSomething like two-thirds of Kenyans now use the M-Pesa, as much as 43% of national GDP flows through it and 75% of the country\u2019s financial transactions are handled by the system.\n\n\nImage from gettyimages\n\nYet only 40% of Kenyans have a bank account. With the M-Pesa, the \u2018unbanked\u2019 now have access to basic financial services. People can deposit and withdraw money, transfer money (even to non-users), pay bills, buy airtime and, in some cases, actually transfer money to a bank account. They can even obtain credit.\n\nThe result is that \u2018financial inclusion is reported to be at 80% in Kenya\u2019, as Sitoyo Lopokoiyit of Safaricom says. \"When you remove mobile money, it drops to 23%. So you can see what mobile money does for financial inclusion in Kenya.\"\n\nThe Kenyan economy is booming relative to its neighbours. It grew by 5.7% last year to become the fourth biggest in sub-Saharan Africa. Economists now consider it a \u2018middle-income country\u2019, rather than a low-income one. Nairobi is Africa\u2019s tech hub, drawing comparisons with Bangalore and Silicon Valley.\n\nThe M-Pesa is just the beginning. With a truly international currency like Bitcoin, the possibilities are enormous.\n\nBitcoin and other forms of mobile money are to banking what the cell phone was to the landline.\n\nEdit: forgot the link  http://www.virgin.com/entrepreneur/...king-what-the-cell-phone-did-to-communication", "I wish I had read this 2 years ago.", "jon.a said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nI wish I had read this 2 years ago.Click to expand...\n\nIsn't there a phrase that goes something like \"by the time an investment's potential is public knowledge, you've already missed the opportunity\"?\n\nPut another way, you won't hear about the next Microsoft by waiting on the sidelines for the news outlets to report on it.", "JAJT said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nIsn't there a phrase that goes something like \"by the time an investment's potential is public knowledge, you've already missed the opportunity\"?\n\nPut another way, you won't hear about the next Microsoft by waiting on the sidelines for the news outlets to report on it.Click to expand...\n\nI'm slow.", "JAJT said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nIsn't there a phrase that goes something like \"by the time an investment's potential is public knowledge, you've already missed the opportunity\"?\n\nPut another way, you won't hear about the next Microsoft by waiting on the sidelines for the news outlets to report on it.Click to expand...\n\nHmmm, I remember thinking this same thing about Apple and Amazon stock starting around 2001.

That's a damn huge spread.\n\nthat's just one way the banks make money.  Ironically they also frequently buy US treasuries with Fed money.  It is equivalent to me loaning you money at 0% and then you loaning it to another person for 2%.  Free profits.\n\nBtc is completely different.  It is a way to get OUT of the banking system.

Supply + demand.\n\nHere's a chart of the current supply https://blockchain.info/charts/total-bitcoins    and 3,600 new coins are mined daily. Supply gets cut in half every 4 years until 21,000,000 are released.\n\nMiners have expenses to cover (hardware + electricity, rent, etc) so there is consistent selling pressure during this phase of distribution.\n\nThink of bitcoins as scarce space on a global distributed ledger. The higher people value space on this ledger the higher the price goes. When more and more uses come online the price should increase as well. All uses won't have the same price impact though. Some uses, such as colored coins, where you can mark a \"satoshi\" 1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin as an asset that can be traded in a fast, secure, and un-restricted way may have little impact on the price (although increase the overall perceived value of the network) while other use-cases such as Store of Value can have an insane impact on the price.\n\nA globally accessible, verifiable, distributed ledger with property that is not only fungible but cannot be counterfeited should become an excellent way to store wealth imo. It has all of the properties that make gold a chosen store of value but it can be accessed from anywhere and transported globally in seconds. So I believe the price affecting  super use-case of bitcon as SoV will happen. It only makes sense.\n\nBecause this post talks about price movements I'l add my disclaimer again. Do not invest based on my opinions. You could lose everything. The original post was made about a technology, not an investment", "Leo Hendrix said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nOh btw, how will the fact that there can only be 21 million btc ever affect its future price?

Right now, there's only about 13 million or so mined, which means in circulation. \n\nThe reason for the price increasing is Bitcoin's scarcity, it's like gold there's only so much to go around. Compared with Fiat currency which is unlimited. \n\nIn Fiat currency, if the demand increases, more is printed. However what this does is dilute the value of the currency since more is added into circulation. Which is why a dollar in 1960 is different in value to one in 2014. Eventually all Fiat currency's go to 0. \n\nIn Bitcoin, if you need more money, the value of the coins increase. This works because as Jake explained, it's possible to send 0.00000001 Bitcoins. So basically if Bitcoin was worth 1M$ it would be possible to send only one cent. Eventually 12 million coins won't be enough for the demand so the value will basically increase until we can start sending multiples of Bitcoins like the Satoshi. \n\nSo let's say the value is 1B$ now since the demand is bigger. 0.00000001 Bitcoins would now be worth 10$ which allows more people to use it since 10$ is only a 100 millionth of a Bitcoin. So now instead of people using whole Bitcoins they would use multiples. \n\nI hope I explained this good enough. \n\nBitcoin Rocks!", "jon.a said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nI wish I had read this 2 years ago.Click to expand...\n\nwhen I was 17 I stumbled onto the silk road and tried to wrap my head around bitcoins......The price was flashing at a mere 13 dollars.

While dollars halves its value in 10 years because of inflation and money printing.Click to expand...\n\nAll the gold that has ever been mined in history up until this point in history is estimated at 171,300 tons. Pricing at 1500 US dollars per troy ounce as of April 2013, is estimated at 8 trillion dollars. The price for that same ounce in 1913 (just before the federal reserve was created, the dollar lost 96-98% of it's value since then) was 20 bucks.\n\nSo going off of that, 8 trillion dollars in 1913 money when the US dollar was at it's strongest, would've been $339,976,905,609.19 billion at that time. Here's an article from reuters saying that the war cost more than 1.7 trillion (that's leaving out benefits to be paid out to veterans totaling 490 billion but estimated to grow to 6 trillion in the next four decades). \n\nLet's round up to 2 trillion. Going off of that number, 2 trillion in 1913 would've been $83,182,442,623.02 billion dollars, or a quarter of all gold that's been mined in human history. (Here's the inflation calculator I used to get those figures so you can test them: Link)\n\nYou're right, it would cost less in more powerful dollars and they could still fund it. \n\nBut instead of being able to endlessly print off money, they'd have to raise taxes. Insanely.\n\nIf the war has cost 2 trillion so far and it's stretched out over 10 years, that's 200 billion per year. With the current population of the US (317 million) that'd be 630 dollars per person, per day.  Which means they would have to go door to door with a dollar sign embroidered sack, every single day, asking for 630 from every single man, woman and child in the continental United States of America.\n\nI think I'd pretty quickly declare my neutrality and move to Switzerland with that in mind. \n\nSorry if I seem to be making this overly political, this isn't really about the war in Iraq. This is about war in general. 1913 was the year that the federal reserve bank came into being and was allowed to just print fake money that wasn't backed by anything. World war 1 (for the US), began on July 28th, 1914, the very next year.\n\nWhat would typically happen before this insane printing of fake money able to finance endless wars, was that the warring countries would just fight each other into a stalemate until they had no more resources left to continue it. With the development of fiat currency, that allowed them the ability to just wage war permanently if they were so inclined.\n\nEven in Roman times, Rome was able to keep fighting their endless wars because they just kept melting down their gold coins and diluting them. Near the end of the Roman empire, their currency had been devalued by 98%.\n\nKind of an eerie parallel.\n\nYou can't do that with Bitcoin. It has a set amount of coins in existence, or that ever will exist. You can't keep devaluing them. And since they can keep being traded in smaller and smaller increments, you don't have to worry about them all getting destroyed and having no currency anymore.\n\n0.00000001 BTC is the smallest increment that Bitcoin can go to. So that will never realistically be a problem.\n\nBeing unable to print out endless money is one of the big reasons why banks, governments and other assorted entrenched financial interests are scared to death of what a technology like Bitcoin represents. Printing money won't be possible.\n\nThat's a whole lot of political power and political favors that go straight out the window. If I were involved with the financial industry in a high level capaity, you'd be damn sure that Bitcoin would have my attention.\n\nWhen they talk about \"competing\" with Bitcoin, they don't actually mean they're going to have fair, free market capitalistic competition that's decided by the consumer. What the banks mean is that they're going to go straight to the government and start lobbying to put restrictions on BTC/crypto-currency technology.\n\nFrom what I read and what I personally think, the US won't go the route of China and ban Bitcoin outright. People are too aware of Bitcoin now, and their window for doing that under the radar pretty much passed. They still could, but people would blatantly see what they were doing.\n\nMost likely, they'll just keep trying to link Bitcoin to the funding of terrorism. To being the main currency used to purchase drugs and weapons, and being the sole form of currency used by child molesters all over the world and until the end of time. So they'll try to keep getting more and more regulations passed to limit the usefulness of Bitcoin, so it gets to a point where no one wants to bother using it because it's such a pain in the a$$.\n\nYou can see this by the Bitcoin licensing they just did in New York, and stuff like this sting operation that went down to bust a guy trying to trade bitcoins in person. \n\nTo use the analogy of Stefan Molyneux (the one speaking in the video I posted), instead of taking a sledgehammer to the engine and breaking it to pieces, the government/financial sector will just stand back and keep throwing little bits of sand into it. And bit by bit, it'll start to break down until most people will find it so difficult and cumbersome to use, they'll just say \"Well, Bitcoin was interesting idea in theroy...but it just didn't work out.\"\n\nI think that's the real danger from the government/financial sector going forward. I'll again echo what Molyneux spoke and say that it seems like most BTC users aren't getting just how mind-bogglingly massive the entrenched interests we're going up against are. Anyway, that's my 2 cents.\n\nFor anyone who doesn't fully understand Bitcoin wanting to get a clear, concise picture of what Bitcoin actually is, here's a video that's pretty good at explaining the whole thing:", "We are in the middle of a technology revolution, and this revolution is on a similar magnatude as the industrial revolution. Its funny as most people dont even realise this. Bitcoin is just a small part, the internet is breaking down barriers all over the place, breaking up old monopolies and reducing the cost of a lot of things.\n\nIf you dont start a business now in the middle of the biggest revolution ever you will seriously kick yourself when your older.\n\np.s.

Most people are totally naive about the dangers of complacency. Afterall, it's too easy to conform and what's the reward of putting up with strife when it's not truly necessary, most would say. I've seen way too many brilliant people slip into mediocre lives because they simply conform. Sad, but true. Yep, people will even stay in dead-end jobs that have little upward mobility, stagnant relationships and the list goes on .... just because they fear change or don't think they're worthy of doing better.
