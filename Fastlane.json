Which is what brings me to the fact that these elite schools are also places where other big winner parents send their kids. Its an opportunity for kids and parents alike to run in those circles if they so choose to seize it. On one hand it might stifle some rugged hands-on dirty work, but it also might get them an in with the right people. I know the trend says otherwise... But see, its tempting to buy a perceived advantage when you can.\n\nMy wife attended private school and a public college. I attended a public school and a private college.

Most of my classmates are doing fine in high end slowlane stuff like accounting, law, banking, and construction.  We only graduated 6 years ago, but I suspect my high school classmates will be the future movers and shakers of the city (or state) just like their parents.  For example, everyone in my high school friend group has parents that are either: multimillionaire entrepreneurs  or elected government officials.  Good connections to have.\n\nI'm personally sending my future kids to a Catholic private high school, the top international school in my city if I'm still living abroad, or homeschooling them.  I have major issues with the public schooling system in the US.", "I am terrified about what to do about education and children. Like this keeps me up at night worrying kind of terrified. I HATED school growing up. They try to stick you in a box, and cater to the lowest common denominator. It turns you into a retarded robot.\n\nI am not any smarter than anyone else, and a lot less intelligent that most of the people on the this forum. However, when I am interested in something I can run with it. I remember in high school I took some 3 credit computer courses, that had extra 1 credit modules that we could take. Me and a buddy were up to 7 credits in the first week of the course, and we spend the rest of our time getting high scores in space invaders (I won that one haha). The teacher eventually said we didn't need to bother showing up anymore, so we didn't. I ended up skipping probably half my classes by getting agreements from the teachers saying that I didn't need to show up. You need 100 credits to graduate high school, I finished with about 130 and had nearly the entire grade 12 off (aka drinking beer at friends houses instead)\n\nUnfortunately most school (especially at lower grades) don't let you have any freedom like that. You finish your work or are interested in something else and they force you into that box, and make you sit there doing literally nothing while the tards finish up. Gotta piss or are hungry? Wait your turn, wait until I say so, or just sit there and suck it up.\n\nYou are creative and have crazy dreams about the world? That is all madness and stop dreaming or thinking. You will be lucky to get a job working for someone else. Just sit there and do what we say, when we say it, and maybe you will graduate and \"better yourself\" at a university.\n\nI had the life thoroughly crushed out of me for such a long time. I was an enterprising young fellow who always ran little businesses and was the one who people went to to borrow money from. Then somewhere between high school and secondary education I had my dreams crushed completely out of me. It took me well into my 20's to start to even reclaim any of that. And now in my early 30's to finally get myself back. If I had even half the understanding at 20 that I do today.... wow. I think not being indoctrinated so much in my younger years would have really helped.\n\nI have no idea what I am going to do for education with my children when the time comes. But I do want to gather a group of like minded individuals, who have children roughly the same age, and figure something out together. The current system is shit. \"Business as usual\" pisses me off more than almost anything else in the world. The education is one of the best examples of \"business as usual\" that you could possibly find. Time to change it up. That change HAS to start with us because the government sure as hell isn't going to take that challenge on.", "Kak said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nRep++ Great Post!\n\nAt 8 years old, you gave a sh*t?Click to expand...\n\nThanks for the reps. Excuse the thread jack lol.\n\nI didn't really have the ability to express myself or reflect fully at that time. But I did have an awareness on what barriers I would hit, what gates that just wouldn't open for me, no matter what I did.\n\nAs I'm Asian, I was, and am, subjected to a lot of comparisons and criticism. Parents would take their children's accomplishments and measure them up to others. Pretty unhealthy...a tough SCRIPT mechanism.\n\nSo, yes, I grew up having to give a shit on some things that might affect my performance ratings for my parents....\n\nI don't subscribe to that SCRIPT doctrine anymore. One good thing about it though, was that I worked and observed my a$$ off from an early age, regardless of whether comparing children with others was morally right or wrong. \n\nIt's somehow akin to learning a lot in jobs before you go out to start a Fastlane business.\n\nBTW, it's not romantic heroism to have a 'give a shit' mentality early in childhood. I paid very dearly for it. I could have paid a lower price, but I was timid and didn't know enough about critical thinking.\n\n\n\n\nGPM said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nUnfortunately most school (especially at lower grades) don't let you have any freedom like that.

I'm not a parent, but I ask the same questions.\n\nI have met several homeschooled families over the years. The interesting part is that they at least have their tires on the fastlane stripes or are completely in the fastlane.\n\n\nOne is a couple that met while he was doing music. Now he's an artist that runs his own shop. They homeschooled/went to montessori schools. They were incredibly talented, sharp, athletic, well-behaved kids that seemed born in the fast lane mentality\nAnother I met while they were figuring out their next business venture. They were living on a huge plot of land with extended family, coasting on savings and figuring out what they wanted to do. I didn't get the impression that they were loaded with money coming out of their ears, but they had enough of a cushion to relax, vacation and party while figuring out their brick and mortar venture\nYet another was one of the most genuinely positive, friendly, welcoming family I've ever met. They own a business that's somewhere in the 8-9 figure range. All of their kids are humble, great, intelligent, and light up the room. Yet they all stayed out of trouble with drugs and big problems whereas their extended family did not. Homeschooled. One of them attended a very specific private college that was known for not being like a typical party school\n\nThe upper middle class people, or the managerial class people that are still deep in the slow lane raise the most dangerous kids in my experience. I've seen them torn apart by drugs, attempted suicide, and massive entitlement.\n\nOne case in particular stands out. His father was pretty high up in management, but wanted his son to learn something about working. So he got his son hired at his local office. When his son was asked to do something at work:\n\"I don't have to do that because my dad's the boss\"\nHe later attempted to kill himself in a very ineffective way as a cry for help. He kind of pulled his life together a little bit, but then fell off the map.\n\nI think the people scampering for upper middle class have some kind of chip on their shoulder and something to prove, and have the means to spoil their children such that they never get the cold hit of reality until the damage has been done.", "My apologies for not kicking this off sooner... It turned out to be a much busier trip for me than anticipated.\n\nI am home now and I have unpacked some of my thoughts.\n\nSome of you may know that I am in the process of getting my pilot's license and this may be cheesy to some, but I am noticing a lot of parallels and analogies between the business world, as my limited experience can describe, and flight. The size of an airplane is like the size of our businesses.\n\nKnowledge- There is a tremendous difference in the amount of knowledge and experience required to be built up before you can fly a big jet... Some might say \"I don't have the experience or knowledge required to start a business like that\", but just like flight, you can learn. All the studying in the world, all the flying of Cessnas, is never going to prepare you to sit behind the controls of a jet. Pilots have to FLY a jet to learn a jet.\n\nNo one was born with the ability to fly a jet. Likewise no one was born with the ability to fly a Cessna either... The same goes for business. Folks will bitch about thinking big. \"Oh, I'll just \"do\" ecommerce for now until I build up some capital or experience\" It is a bullshit excuse. So you don't have the ability to set out to solve a legitimate problem, but you somehow have the ability to \"revoloutionize\" the cell phone case market with new color? No. Once again it comes back to becoming the expert. You must DO. You must ACT. There is NO ONE that will hold your hand and teach you how to start a seriously impactful business. Guess what... Thats OK! In fact it is real entrepreneurship. Following a step by step guide isn't. You'll F*cking crash.\n\nTake off- Quite simply put, the larger the plane, the more runway it normally needs to take off. While a tiny lightweight backcountry airplane can take off with almost no rollout, the large jets need thousands of feet to safely take off. This parallels with business because the larger the problem you are solving, the bigger the company it is anticipated to be, the longer it is going to take before it can transfer it's weight from the wheels to the wings.\n\nBarrier to entry? Yes. A jet needs a bigger runway... You can look at that runway as the blood, sweat and tears needed to be put in before your business can take off. Difficult is good for the people who have done it and bad for bozo wannabe competitors. This is the part where you LEARN! This is the part that builds you as a businessperson. This is the part that makes you EXPERIENCED. Have you ever wondered why some people get to the point where they don't feel the need to prove anything? Have you wondered why some people remain calm in the worst of times? They have been down a hell of a runway. The entrepreneur and the business is stronger for this.\n\nThis part goes along with my thread about what I would do if I started all over again. In that thread I basically make the case for a well capitalized business in order to ride out the run up first, and then climb faster. Need a bigger runway? OK... Build one.\n\nClimb out- Larger jets, once they are finished rolling out climb like crazy to altitudes you cant touch in a small piston airplane.\n\nThis is the day you realize you quite literally could disrupt an entire market. There are growing pains that are bigger than if you were a small business, but so what? Your idea paid off and you are filling the organizational holes with resources on your way up as you leave the small business concerns like getting the cheapest phone system, using your office depot coupons or renting the cheapest shit heap office space you can find in your dust. You have cashflow and cash balence to work out most of the pressing problems.\n\nCarrying capacity- I view this like a business' ability to carry resources. While a jet can carry hundreds of passengers, small airplanes have massive weight restrictions and fuel capacity considerations. With a smaller plane you need to make sacrifices in range to carry more weight and vice versa. Sound familiar?\n\nHow much inventory can you invest in at once? What kind of resources can your business carry? Can you afford a professional web designer or are you stuck trying your own hand? Can you afford to advertise to the extent you desire? Could your business accept a massive order without cashflow issues? How many ecommerce businesses could hire just one new person today and maintain a comfortable income for the proprietor? Some airplanes simply can't carry more than two or three people at a time, they are just too small and light. Everything in a small business is a trade off. Resources grow businesses.\n\nRough weather- It is inevitable that you will run into bad weather, the cool part is that jets fly over most of the bullshit. A small airplane can easily be murdered by the same storm a jet can simply fly over. Not only that, but a jet can intentionally fly through most shit that a small plane has to concern itself with. Small planes are constantly trying to avoid bad weather and adjust for changing conditions.\n\nWhat happens when marketplace policies change? What happens when advertising gets more expensive? What happens when taxes go up? What happens when you have a legal problem? The list goes on and on. Things that might simply shake a jet can rip the wings off a cessna.\n\nEase of operation- I don't think anyone would argue that with modern autopilots and avionics, a jet isn't a more pleasant aircraft to fly. They are, and they're less work. This is self explanatory. Look at a CEO of a company that employs just 20 people vs a onepreneur... The CEO looks at his business from 35 thousand feet and the onepreneur is probably at 5 getting hands dirty and worrying about navigating around the next dark cloud.\n\nWhat is my point?\n\nAll of this is not to say that you can't take a small company and turn it into a large company, but more often than not, the companies that become household names, the companies that employ 50, 1000, or even 100 thousand people are ones that were planned bigger from the start.\n\nI personally only give a damn about jets. Any Cessna stuff is a means to an end for me. You will see that my main businesses, as I progress and discuss them further, fit the criteria of the jet. Not because they grew into it, but because that is where I started them; despite some of the mistakes I've made and will discuss like trying to fly a \"jet\" off of a \"cessna\" runway.\n\nSorry if it's cheesy or elementary for some, but this is the kind of stuff that rolls through my head."], "Page1": ["Congratulations on your succes and even though everybody seems to forgets, also congratulations on your marriage.\n\n\n\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});", "Kak said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nHe said he has never worked with a supplier that has gone so above and beyond to protect his interests in his life and has since given me the opportunity to not only sell this same product to him again, but has asked me to source most of his raw materials.

As usual. Sorry that's such a pattern. It has definitely been an incredible learning experience. I know @Vigilante is privy to some of the details of this time away... I decided it would be a huge shame not to use what I have learned to help some of you. I also plan to do what I can to stick with this although the companies suck up a major portion of my time.\n\nFirst of all, I got married back in April to a wonderful woman and I am thrilled I got her. She is amazing, I love her very much and I am extremely happy I married her. So to those of you who think you can't have a successful business and a wife or family are wrong, you just have to be deliberate and make sure you create systems that allow you to spend time away from the business. Its worth it. No judging here, just don't let entrepreneurship stop you from pursuing a rewarding relationship if it is something you are interested in.\n\nNow on to the business stuff... I am convinced that we all will be humbled at some point. The fortunate part is it is probably one of the largest stepping stones to the success there is. I can't believe the shaky foundations I have tried to build on in the past viewing from where I stand now. I have gone through so many times in my life where I felt like I couldn't lose. Like I had the world by the balls. Sometimes you need the world to kick your a$$ to realize something better might be out there.\n\nThe following few stories I'm going to share show how being diligent in hard times is so important. I will start with part of the first story on this post.\n\nOk. I have been attempting to source raw materials for very large companies. Companies you would know. This had initially been a project I took on for fun because I saw some opportunity. I eventually found demand for something huge and went after it. It took over a year to find this particular product. I worked and worked. Through supplier after supplier. Country after country. I must have had the same discussion with 1000 different potential suppliers. I have spent thousands of dollars on samples that didn't pan out. Plane tickets to meetings that didn't pan out. Shit wasn't going right. I wanted to quit because this sourcing crap didn't even matter, I was making money elsewhere, but I decided a long time ago that if \"its too hard\" is my reason I will not quit. I refuse to be a pussy.\n\nFinally, after all of that blood, sweat and tears, I found the material in China, at a price where I could make an ongoing mid six figures per month. I thought the blood sweat and tears were over. This was by far the biggest kind of deal I had ever done. It was amazing and exciting. I sailed through the process of sending samples and supporting documents to potential customers. Doing my best to look like a way bigger company than I am. Finally, One bit. Hard. Within about a month I had money being put into a letter of credit for the first of what would be 6-10 similar transactions per month. It was there. Way more income than I have ever had in my life was sitting in limbo. It was a side project about to blow past my other businesses. It was sitting there ready for me to transfer just a fraction out to my supplier. That fraction happened to be about 100k by the way. The remaining chunk would be mine when the LOC cleared.\n\nWells Fargo made the transfer a pain, every step of the way they would need some other bs for me to create. I ended up on my honeymoon during this deal because it took a few weeks to get this done. My wife being the awesome chick she is was supportive and found it hilarious when I needed to get a document notarized in Cabo. We went to like 7 places before one just took 20 bucks to stamp my document. Finally I was in compliance with all of the regulatory crap. Honestly it probably wasn't because the Mexican notary may have just been a guy with a stamp. Whatever, now I can relax and look at million dollar vacation homes and have fun on my honeymoon because big money is on the way. Back at home I got confirmation from Wells that the transfer was a success and the credit was now offered to my supplier. I was excited to tell them that evening, but evidently they already knew. The supplier we had been in discussions with for months, who supplied a rock solid sample was completely unreachable. Their website gone. Phones disconnected. Email bouncing.

We went to trade shows and did normal touristy stuff, then one day when overlooking the Hong Kong skyline we saw some helicopters flying in and out.\n\nHe said something along the lines, with a smile and zero doubt in his eyes,\n\n\"They make those for a reason you know? It's made for people like us! Just imagine flying like that from one meeting to another\"\n\nIt blew my mind at the time, because I was such a rookie and had so many mental barriers about success.

However, as @Walter Hay has pointed out, that is not necessarily a litmus test as their certification process now involves the company paying money to Alibaba to reach their \"gold seller\" platform. \n\nThe situation @Kak encountered was a deliberate fraudulent fake business, with physical (fake) locations, contacts, web sites, and more.  He wasn't the first to encounter them (as we learned later) but was probably the only one to get his money back thanks in part to the United States banking system, and his tenacity to not roll over.  You need to understand KAK heard \"too bad for you\" hundreds of times by low level and mid level executives.  He just didn't stop. \n\nCompanies like Wells Fargo make decisions based on their assessment of their own exposure.  Ultimately him getting his money back was in no way because they decided to do the right thing.  It was solely based on what they assessed their exposure to be from not securing his funds.  999 out of 1,000 times, the money would have been lost.

I know first hand from the drug world when I was younger what people will go through to screw you over some cash. Put my trust barriers in place and opened my eyes. This story had me on edge though.", "Kak said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nI am going to go ahead and begin sharing another story. I won't try to put a label on the lesson learned here because there are so dang many I learned from this it would be a disservice to focus on just one.\n\nThis story is an extremely tough one to unpack for me. It is the biggest business sacrifice I have ever made. I'm not talking about a few grand here or there like the sourcing deal. I'm not even talking about some guy's 100k. I'm talking about the better part of a million dollars spent. Some investor money and some was my own. I'm talking about hundreds of meetings. Supplier turnover because of no movement. Explaining myself to investors. Continuing to believe in my business through hundreds upon hundreds of naysayers, liars, disinterested decision makers.\n\nI have touched on this project in other threads briefly. A very select few of you know exactly what this is. There are absolutely things I would have done differently knowing what I know today, but I haven't given up and I don't plan to.\n\nThe story begins on August second of 2013. Over three whole years ago. I formed a corporation, opened a bank account and dropped the first 100k of investor money in it. My idea was ingenious. My numbers were incredible. I had a solution I was going to sell to the biggest customer in the world. The government.\n\nNot only were the numbers incredible... They were figures that could make me and my investors billionaires, every single year over and over diminishing as I put a complete end to a serious problem we have in this country. Republican, democrat, it didn't matter, it would appeal to either side. I felt like I had the world by the balls and my investors were convinced I did to. Investors chased me down. I didn't even have to look. The idea was that good. Lets just quantify and get on with the story... The problem affected 1.1 million people in Texas the year I filed my formation. Each one of those people would be worth an average of $800 in value to my company, net. Remember, that is just Texas.Click to expand...\n\nWithin a month of that formation, I had a technology supply and custom solutions in the pipeline. I had a contract with technicians and call centers. I had merchant services. I had the entire operations puzzle figured out. Almost completely outsourced I might add. I had net 30 contracts with all of the large expenses we would have this way we could scale infinitely because we would have our return before the bill even showed up. I proceeded to hire a lobbyist and go after the sales aspect. Now, this was not some ordinary expense, this was an entire executive salary and at the time was more money than I usually made per month. I had to really trust him. And I did.\n\nWe went forward with lobbying for the next 2 years. Half of the time was out of session and half of the time was in session. In dealing with government, you will begin to notice a pattern. Everyone \"likes\" what you have to say, but either they are not the decision maker, you can never find the decision maker, no one wants to make a decision or they just lied to you. It's safe for anyone to tell you how great you and your product are with no commitment in government. So we continued to work at it and get our positive feedback. Session came around and some other topics took precedence and we didn't get exactly what we wanted. 2 years of hard work almost down the drain except for one thing... We moved the decision maker to the local level. We had an amendment on one bill that made it so the decision is up to a more local level.\n\nAt this point I am really on the edge. I am running our of investor resources. I don't want to take any more investor money because I don't want to give up much more ownership. I had to let my lobbyist go which was an extremely disappointing day. We had become good friends, and still are, but it sucked to have dissolve the working relationship. My investors are still supportive, but getting a little antsy.\n\nI toiled away trying to do my own lobbying work at the local level. I pounded the phones. I worked so hard on it. Finally, I was exhausted... I couldn't do it any more. I was spending a LOT of my own money at this point and I was into my 3rd year. I considered giving in. I considered letting it beat me. I went days and sometimes weeks not working on it, but not admitting it was over.\n\nThen came a huge blessing... One of the people who were beating down my door 2 and a half years prior to get in to the business. I turned him down at the time, but he asked me how the project was going. I said terrible, there isn't anything there. I myself wouldn't even invest, being fully honest. This guy is worth tens of millions and has been a friend for a while. He said, \"stop by the office tomorrow and let's talk about it. I want to see what you've got.\"\n\nI put together a presentation for him about what had been done and what is still left to do. Where we are in the project. Then basically, don't invest, I wouldn't. Then he told me his reason for having me down. He was selling one of his real estate holdings for north of 15 million dollars. He evidently had to put together some sort of exchange program to avoid taxes, but before he did that he wanted to make sure my project was still off the table. After my presentation he said he sees progress on a company that will obviously take a long time and a lot of resources to launch and that to him it looked like the right time to buy. Again, I told him I wouldn't invest in this company, I don't believe in it anymore and you might be wasting your money. He replied I didn't get where I am today by being careful with everything I did. I see potential, and with the check I am about to write I think you will believe in it again too. He ended up writing a very large check for only 13 percent in the company, but he had one condition... That I took him to the meetings so he could not only see how his investment was doing first hand, but he has always been interested in the political process. I accepted and he was right, his investment made me believe in it again. Someone was finally sold on the deal.\n\nTo be continued..", "Congrats on getting married my friend!

Sometime's it's the medical director, sometimes it's the hospital chief of staff, sometimes it's the CFO cutting off all nonessential expenditures.  In many cases you'll have people try to position themselves as the decision maker when they are far from it.\n\nWhat type of funding mechanism were/are you looking for at the state level?  One thing we've learned with \"open solicitation\" grants is that they are often anything but open.  At the NIH level for example they often create an open grant solicitation where they have a winner in mind already, but need to put on a show that they are considering all offers.  I learned this the hard way at at one conference where a company rep in a similar arena told me (after too many drinks) that they already had won the grant, all that was left was for her to actually send in an application so there was a paper trail and the appearance of a competitive process.\n\nSo, if you can convince whatever area of government you are looking for to make an open solicitation grant to solve the problem you are addressing, it's possible you can have a grant pre-written for you to win.

How did you find him and ascertain that he was effective in the first place? Lobbying is a pretty unusual job. Were the people you were trying to convince considered in the process (i.e., did you hire an alumni from their college, a brother from their fraternity, someone who used to be an exec at the company they used to work for, etc.)?\n\nDid you have any process in place to make sure your desires were in the minds of the politicians without becoming a nag or a nuisance?Click to expand...\n\nGREAT QUESTION!\n\n\nFirst and foremost know your topic. If you are lobbying for something related to healthcare for instance... Your first course of action is to take a look at who is on the healthcare committees in the house and senate.\n\nThe committees are the only thing that really matters on an issue, if legislation gets out of a republican run committee in house and senate and republicans are the majority... most of the time it will pass. Likewise on the democrat side. Also note that NOBODY, but the committee reads the fricking bills. They look to the committee leaders and vote with them. It is sad, but it is the reality. Also, unless there is a really well respected member or the chair, the minority party committee members are usually a waste of time.\n\nThat said... Political donations are a public record... You can look up the chairs of your committee and find out the companies that have donated the most to their campaigns... The lobbyists that represent these companies have spent some time and effort in those offices on other issues and they are a good bet. Not to mention they have more clout when they have donated more. So essentially you get to ride the coattails of bigger companies a bit.\n\nRemember ALL of this is relationship building, you never want to burn bridges and your lobbyist will get mad if you do.\n\nNow all of this said, I met my first lobbyist at a function for a charity I support and got lucky. But the one I currently have now I found the way I just described. He is much cheaper and we have some other deals worked out but he isnt the same caliber either.\n\n\nNow to keep from being annoying, you must genuinely seek to make their lives easier by presenting things that solve their problems.

Win for them because they get to trade their time for a value they agree is a worthwhile amount and you get to trade money for what you consider is a worthwhile resource.\n\nThree weeks ago my lobbyist brought to my attention that a very well connected figure in the area just lost election and was looking for work. Not only could he pick apart the local bureaucracy better than just about anyone I could think of, he was hungry for some consulting work. Heck yes. Set up the meeting.\n\nWe all sit down for the meeting and he is super interested in working for us and wants to \"send him a proposal\". Well, at the same time, I really don't want to pay top dollar for yet another resource. This guy wasn't going to take some commission deal either. This crap is getting expensive, and I am enjoying banking some of this at this point. Another 10 grand per month sounds sucky, but he is a good bet.\n\nThroughout the meeting the guy was bringing up an use for our technology that no one had ever thought of. He kept driving home how big of an opportunity it would be in this role and how he could sell it in this role in his sleep. My partner and I were rolling our eyes at this crap because everyone has something to say about their big ideas, but they want you to carry it out.\n\nAfter the meeting my partner and I had a few cups of coffee and discussed the strategy that this potential new hire came up with. We loved it, but the thought of paying another consultant had us weighing whether we wanted to focus efforts locally or not.\n\nThen I had the idea I call turning nothing into lemonade. The deployment Idea that he had. He was super excited about it. He kept going on and on about how great of an Idea it was for this specific role. I said, why don't we feed his ego and multiply our winnings here. I decided to form an entirely new company. One which took that new idea he loved so much and made it its own company. Remember, we weren't even going to attempt this 4 hours earlier. We had never even heard of this use, but it did look like an opportunity.\n\nWe proceeded to draft our proposal giving him a 20% stake in the new company in exchange for representing our interests across the board. We would provide the operations aspect for the new company. Sliding this over to him this morning about made his jaw hit the floor. I said, we think you would be a valuable addition to the team and this was the best way we could come up with to make you rich. This is a nice chunk of stock that will pay distributions, and be a great retirement when we liquidate. He agreed and said where do I sign?\n\nThis is a glowing example of creating something out of nothing. I pay exactly nothing for this. Not only did we retain the help of this resource, we made him extremely happy. I also took home 80% of the stock in an entirely new company, one that we have a built in salesman and already built out operations.\n\nWin-WinClick to expand...\n\nI have no words...

In my research, unless you have a capacitor system that runs your home when the sun is not out, it makes more sense to have a 60/40 or 70/30 setup. Basically 60% solar and 40% grid. I understand a lot of people sell energy off of their property, but we are talking mass appeal, not just farmers and semi-entrepreneurial people here. For 90% of people this is so much cheaper and to me looks like a better ROI for a few reasons...\n\nBuying enough panels to run the entire home would require buying enough to not only actively run the home, but to also charge the capacitor system. So you would be buying 120-150% of the load necessity of your home. That means twice as many panels and a very expensive capacitor system. Couple that with the fact that the technology is ever evolving and getting better, you would have to keep upgrading a much larger and more expensive system.\n\nSo. If I were a customer, I would want to leave my home partially on the grid so that I can benefit from stable electricity delivery and from a cheaper overall project cost.\n\nNow, due to the fact that your energy bill is a monthly expense... This has interesting financing written all over it.\n\nIf it were my business I would go out to put together a package for every 1000kWh they want to pull their home off of the grid. Then the math is easy for your average idiot.\n\nIf you are paying 12.5 cents per kWh (which is about average around here) you are paying $125 for every 1000kWh.\nTo me that means you should be selling your 1000 kWh solar system with payment plans of $120 per month for X number of months until it is paid off then it is obviously free.\nSave $5/month now, it's not much, but they are paying toward a bigger goal and saving money doing it.\n\nBasically the financing makes it so that you can basically sell them money from day 1 instead of them coming up with a big chunk of change.\n\nFinally, your could widen your margins FAR beyond a pay up front plan where they are comparing apples to apples... In essence they will be paying you more for the same system and more happy to do it.\n\nMy first step I would do is crunch the numbers and find out how much these things cost. From there find a bank that will lend on them far enough out to match these terms. It will help if you can keep the panels under warranty for the duration of the financing. Why? Because then when they are done paying, you need to remember that they will have new income burning a hole in their pocket. I would help them spend that by offering an extended warranty maintenance plan or an additional 1000kWh plan.\n\nAnother beautiful part is your marketing in different markets... Find a market that pays $.25 per kWh, charge them $240 per month for the same 1000kWh system.\n\nAlso don't call it financing, hide the interest rates in your margins. That implies debt.

Not talking about starting a road paving company per se, but rather a technology company focused on the construction industry. Construction in my opinion, has been the least technologically advanced industry. For example, road paving companies are still using methods from 30-50 years ago; asphalt + cement. Asphalt plants are extremely harmful to the environment and most are located around communities. Asphalt is expensive and the maintenance costs companies big money.\n\nThere's currently a company in Korea that have produced, via patented technology, soil hardening agents that allow paving to be done by soil. When mixed with water, this combination of hardening agents + soil is STRONGER than asphalt, CHEAPER than asphalt, and more ECO-FRIENDLY than asphalt + cement. Driveways, parking lots, etc. can all be paved using solely this method. Of course, highways and roads where there's a lot of traffic, a small amount of asphalt is thrown into the mix, however, it's mainly soil + the hardening agents. \n\nSo what I was looking to do was start a road paving technology company to import these new products from overseas and try to sell them to these big construction companies. Let's call it a road paving R&D firm. \n\nI would love to hear your insights on this potential model.", "I wrote down on my whiteboard a nice learning from this thread.

I will do my best to answer your question.\n\nFirst and foremost, when we discuss what you should do within a business, maybe we should discuss the business itself.\n\nThere is a difference between owning a company, a small business and being self employed.\n\nOwning a company involves leveraging assets and resources to create a self surviving ecosystem. Something that has the ability to make money independent of your direct input. The owner eventually shouldn't even have to work there. Examples: stores, apartment complexes, webstores, manufacturers.. etc. You get the picture.\n\nA small business usually involves an owner operator. The owner often works at their business. There is some leverage of resources, but the business either can't afford to shed the owner's effort or the owner needs to be heavily involved for other reasons. Think: a bakery, boutique store, photography studio, mechanic shop, contracting, Etsy handmade shops.\n\nSelf employment is really just that... Employed by oneself. Literally you have a job that you do for money without being an employee of someone else. You are basically an employee of your customer. You must trade time for income. Think: consultants, freelancers.\n\nWhen I think web designer... I think freelancer. This is self employment. Are you OK with that?

I will do my best to answer your question.\n\nFirst and foremost, when we discuss what you should do within a business, maybe we should discuss the business itself.\n\nThere is a difference between owning a company, a small business and being self employed.\n\nOwning a company involves leveraging assets and resources to create a self surviving ecosystem. Something that has the ability to make money independent of your direct input. The owner eventually shouldn't even have to work there. Examples: stores, apartment complexes, webstores, manufacturers.. etc. You get the picture.\n\nA small business usually involves an owner operator. The owner often works at their business. There is some leverage of resources, but the business either can't afford to shed the owner's effort or the owner needs to be heavily involved for other reasons. Think: a bakery, boutique store, photography studio, mechanic shop, contracting, Etsy handmade shops.\n\nSelf employment is really just that... Employed by oneself. Literally you have a job that you do for money without being an employee of someone else. You are basically an employee of your customer. You must trade time for income. Think: consultants, freelancers.\n\nWhen I think web designer... I think freelancer. This is self employment. Are you OK with that? Let me know and we can continue.Click to expand...\n\nHi KAK,\n\nawesome thread. You have already helped me very much.\n\nMy question is if you divide small business and company solely by the passivity - grade?

I received similar advice once upon a time.", "@Kak, thank you so much for this thread (and thank you @brokebum for sharing your problems, it was a very educational discussion).\n\nThis might be a bit of an unusual question, but I have a feeling you may have some good insights.\n\nI developed the belief that one should focus on one business alone and never ever try anything else because of the risk of spreading oneself too thin. This belief has served me extremely well, but I have a feeling that now it's restricting me a bit because I'm putting all of my eggs in one basket (which I don't control entirely as I rely heavily on Amazon). Moreover, it's getting harder and harder to think with more zeros as obviously at some point you can no longer grow by hundreds of percent in a year, especially in my type of business, self-publishing (is relies on my direct input).\n\nI know I need to start thinking bigger. I'm not interested in launching another \"small business\" type of a business as described in your recent post as I'm not looking for more obligations, just new ways to deploy my capital and leverage it so that it can eventually run on its own. The problem is how to do it in such a way that it won't jeopardize my self-publishing business.\n\nWhat tips would you give to a person who is considering expanding beyond his or her primary successful venture?

Said where do I sign... THEN became the kind of jackass I would NEVER do business with.\n\nThankfully there was nothing to sign that day. I said we will have to have a subsequent meeting to hammer out the exact performance metrics he needs to hit in order to receive his stock issuance. He said OK lets meet soon. I agreed, I was going out of town on a ski trip to Canada and wanted to get it hammered out BEFORE I left so that he could begin laying groundwork.\n\nI shot him an email the following day... When do you want to meet?... Crickets...\n\nI called him the next day... Left Message... When do you want to meet? Call me back... Nothing\n\nThis goes on for about a week. I get an email. A bunch of questions about the numbers of the new company. A little bit of jackassery that rubbed me the wrong way, but I humored him and answered his questions... Again asked WHEN DO YOU WANT TO MEET?\n\nHe thanks me for answering the questions and doesn't answer my question.\nAt this point I call my lobbyist who hooked me up with this prick. Will you get this guy to answer my question? You know him better maybe he is just a big pussy.\n\nLobbyist proceeds calling, emailing and texting this a**hole while I am in Canada... Nothing. He even called this guy's assistant and asked if he was in the hospital or something... He wasn't. In fact his stupid democrat a$$ was on twitter talking about how great Meryl Streep is. My lobbyist is PISSED. Im PISSED. This a**hole voiced interest in our offer. It was an extremely generous offer and at this point in time it was 19 days since we heard from him.\n\nThe following was his last chance... I sent it to him, basically to say, we understand it was the holidays, but this crap absolutely can not happen again.\n\n(Jackass Name,)\n\n(lobbyist) and I have made extraordinary efforts to get ahold of you, due to your potential value to our company, expressed interest and likelihood of success on both discussed projects we have carried on trying to get ahold of you much longer than we would typically.\n\n\nAs I am sure you can understand, we absolutely can\u2019t have a partner who does not communicate with us, and the amazing value that you could provide is mitigated if this becomes a pattern.\n\n\nWe are simply trying to set up a meeting to hammer out the details of an agreement with you. We always conduct business in a mutually advantageous manner and we planned on dispelling any concerns you might with concessions and annotations in writing, making sure you were 100% comfortable working together.\n\n\nBeing that this is a very large potential opportunity for both of us and that you are unparalleled in the expertise and connections to get all of us across the finish line, I would like to give one last chance to reach out and arrange a meeting with us to get the ball rolling. You have voiced interest in this project to (lobbyist) and myself. If you are actually interested in our generous offer, we need to hear from you ASAP because we are going to begin seeking alternative representation today.\n\n\nThank you (jackass), I look forward to hearing from you.\n\u200bFinally a response after that one... 3 weeks since he agreed to work together.:\n\nMy proposal to serve you is - to be retained and compensated on a monthly basis with an agreement to be retained for the life of any contracts obtained.\n\nMy standard consulting fee starts at $5k a month, with a $5 - $10k initial retainer.\n\nI am willing to adjust this to a $2,500 retainer, with $2,500 a month until a contract is signed, and then it would be adjusted to $5k a month for the life of the contract. For each new contract signed thereafter, I would receive an additional $2,500 a month for the life of each new contract. At the point that at least five contracts have been successfully achieved, I would be willing to consider your original offer of 20% ownership of the company.\u200b\nAbsolutely HILARIOUS. I am no longer interested in doing ANY business with him. This incoherent grasp at money after the least impressive performance of someone trying to win a job I have ever experienced in my life had me DREAMING of what to say next...\n\n-Sorry, but I'm not currently in the market for a $200k per year disappearing act.\n-Your house is worth less than you want to get out of me per year.\n-You have never made that kind of money in your life.\n-Your skillset is so narrow that only I can turn your bullshit into money and you aren't worth 1/10 of what you have requested.\n-I should have trusted my gut about hiring a loser democrat.\n-I even considered telling him how interested I was in the proposal only to wait a month to tell him my counter proposal is $100 per month..\nEtc..\n\nMy actual response to him:\n\nI am sorry, but I am unable to come to those terms. I truly appreciate your reply today and your honest feedback.\n\nIf I can ever be of any networking help, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.\n\nBest Regards,\n\u200bWhy?

Sorry that's such a pattern. It has definitely been an incredible learning experience. I know @Vigilante is privy to some of the details of this time away... I decided it would be a huge shame not to use what I have learned to help some of you. I also plan to do what I can to stick with this although the companies suck up a major portion of my time.\n\nFirst of all, I got married back in April to a wonderful woman and I am thrilled I got her. She is amazing, I love her very much and I am extremely happy I married her. So to those of you who think you can't have a successful business and a wife or family are wrong, you just have to be deliberate and make sure you create systems that allow you to spend time away from the business. Its worth it. No judging here, just don't let entrepreneurship stop you from pursuing a rewarding relationship if it is something you are interested in.\n\nNow on to the business stuff... I am convinced that we all will be humbled at some point. The fortunate part is it is probably one of the largest stepping stones to the success there is. I can't believe the shaky foundations I have tried to build on in the past viewing from where I stand now. I have gone through so many times in my life where I felt like I couldn't lose. Like I had the world by the balls. Sometimes you need the world to kick your a$$ to realize something better might be out there.\n\nThe following few stories I'm going to share show how being diligent in hard times is so important. I will start with part of the first story on this post.\n\nOk. I have been attempting to source raw materials for very large companies. Companies you would know. This had initially been a project I took on for fun because I saw some opportunity. I eventually found demand for something huge and went after it. It took over a year to find this particular product. I worked and worked. Through supplier after supplier. Country after country. I must have had the same discussion with 1000 different potential suppliers. I have spent thousands of dollars on samples that didn't pan out. Plane tickets to meetings that didn't pan out. Shit wasn't going right. I wanted to quit because this sourcing crap didn't even matter, I was making money elsewhere, but I decided a long time ago that if \"its too hard\" is my reason I will not quit. I refuse to be a pussy.\n\nFinally, after all of that blood, sweat and tears, I found the material in China, at a price where I could make an ongoing mid six figures per month. I thought the blood sweat and tears were over. This was by far the biggest kind of deal I had ever done. It was amazing and exciting. I sailed through the process of sending samples and supporting documents to potential customers. Doing my best to look like a way bigger company than I am. Finally, One bit. Hard. Within about a month I had money being put into a letter of credit for the first of what would be 6-10 similar transactions per month. It was there. Way more income than I have ever had in my life was sitting in limbo. It was a side project about to blow past my other businesses. It was sitting there ready for me to transfer just a fraction out to my supplier. That fraction happened to be about 100k by the way. The remaining chunk would be mine when the LOC cleared.\n\nWells Fargo made the transfer a pain, every step of the way they would need some other bs for me to create. I ended up on my honeymoon during this deal because it took a few weeks to get this done. My wife being the awesome chick she is was supportive and found it hilarious when I needed to get a document notarized in Cabo. We went to like 7 places before one just took 20 bucks to stamp my document. Finally I was in compliance with all of the regulatory crap. Honestly it probably wasn't because the Mexican notary may have just been a guy with a stamp. Whatever, now I can relax and look at million dollar vacation homes and have fun on my honeymoon because big money is on the way. Back at home I got confirmation from Wells that the transfer was a success and the credit was now offered to my supplier. I was excited to tell them that evening, but evidently they already knew. The supplier we had been in discussions with for months, who supplied a rock solid sample was completely unreachable. Their website gone. Phones disconnected. Email bouncing.

Comhghairdeas. May your marriage be as successful as your business ventures! Second of all, many thanks for the inspiration, motivation and education. This post is like a flaming cocktail, only with more fire.\n\nI second the above comment and await with bated breath. I already have an amazing young family and am about to hit 30. But after reading the book I was blown away (oh if only I had found it in my early 20's) and have had about 30 different ideas of how to shift to the fast lane. Three of those ideas are solid and I've already decided to grab life by the balls and run with the best of those three, for now. I have secured finance from the government and hired a developer to create the web subscription service, which will be the money pot. I know I can multiply the finance I received x 10 in the first year, easy.\n\nIf I looked at the kind of finance I've received a year ago I would have thought it was a lot of money (it's only 5 figures). Now I look at it and it is buttons, and this is before I have made any significant income. It really is a lot to do with mindset, perception and confidence. All of which I have found in abundance, here and in the book. The important thing is what you DO with those things. You don't just sit and stare at that cocktail. You drink it, and while it's still hot too!\n\nMy family is everything to me and they will always come first. Can I make a shift to fast lane despite, what some would consider, these limitations?\n\nBloody right I can, because I KNOW I can!

I believe laser sharp focus is key to quick growth and success in business, but for the long term, those relationships, such as the one you were looking to build with the jackass, can prove to be very beneficial.\n\nIn your experiences, has the sacrifice been worth it for the long term effects of those relationships?\n\nMoving forward into your 30's, I'm guessing that you may want a family if you don't have one already.

I do what needs to be done. My wife and eventually kids will absolutely come before my businesses, but it never becomes a problem because I make the time.\n\nNow as far as business relationships are concerned, I put them in my phone. If I am not willing to reach out and call that individual, they are not a connection.

Being that the nature of what you consult on is start ups and entrepreneurship... And due to the fact that I like unique and outside of the box deals... I would be bagging the hiring more consultants, why? Because if thy hire you they want you. I have hired consultants in the past where they dish me off to another subconsultant and it sucks.\n\nThat said, If I were you, I would be publicly open to stock deals and royalties for start ups that have a ton of potential, but are a little too lean to be spending $5k on a consultant. That way you are paid on deliverance and also are a partial owner in the new business.\n\nAlso just for a case study. Look up that Tony guy that started P90X. He was a personal trainer 1:1 trading time for money. He eventually developed classes to magnify... Then he brought the fitness DVD to mass-market. This is an alternative model.\n\nI hope this helps!", "Kak said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nNot a problem! I hope it was valuable to you.

I branched out a first time and instead of carrying on doing that, I invested in setting up a franchise for this business. So in other words, I have got 2 beauty salons which are pilot companies for the franchise and a third company which is the franchise.\n\nWhat I am facing now is this:\n- As it is a low paying job, the big majority of the beauty therapists don't have the money to invest in a franchise and the banks won't follow them unless they have 50% of the investment in cash already.\n\nWhat I have:\n- All the systems in place (technical and business training, legal paperwork ready, marketing strategies tested and approved...)\n- The ability to make any franchise profitable from day 1 as I did for mine\n\nWhere I stand:\n- I can't keep opening branches of my own indefinitely as it takes too much of my time and is not the best use for it either.\n- I could wait to find the few therapists that have enough money to invest in a franchise but this is a very slow process \n- I could target wealthier people and sell them the opportunity to invest in one or several franchises or mine with the benefit of reducing taxes, getting the profit of the company and the possibility to resell the company at the end of the franchise agreement and get this money on top of the profit, etc... Basically I deal with everything for them and they just have to invest at the beginning and then collect the profit.\n\nI think I am definitely onto something with this business, I just need to find a way to accelerate its growth.\n\nI would love to have your view on my strategy or any other idea that might cross your mind.\nAny idea as well on how to get in touch with the sort of wealthy people that my deal could be of interest to would be welcome if you have any. \n\nThis is the first time I get one of my businesses to the point where I can realistically hope to go big and I don't intend to let this opportunity go until I have tried everything.\n\nThanks for this thread and all the insight in it.

Which is what brings me to the fact that these elite schools are also places where other big winner parents send their kids. Its an opportunity for kids and parents alike to run in those circles if they so choose to seize it. On one hand it might stifle some rugged hands-on dirty work, but it also might get them an in with the right people. I know the trend says otherwise... But see, its tempting to buy a perceived advantage when you can.\n\nMy wife attended private school and a public college. I attended a public school and a private college.

I guess it varies by the school and even the class.\n\nI attended a private high school with lots of (locally) powerful families.  Most of my classmates are doing fine in high end slowlane stuff like accounting, law, banking, and construction.  We only graduated 6 years ago, but I suspect my high school classmates will be the future movers and shakers of the city (or state) just like their parents.  For example, everyone in my high school friend group has parents that are either: multimillionaire entrepreneurs  or elected government officials.  Good connections to have.\n\nI'm personally sending my future kids to a Catholic private high school, the top international school in my city if I'm still living abroad, or homeschooling them.  I have major issues with the public schooling system in the US.", "I am terrified about what to do about education and children. Like this keeps me up at night worrying kind of terrified. I HATED school growing up. They try to stick you in a box, and cater to the lowest common denominator. It turns you into a retarded robot.\n\nI am not any smarter than anyone else, and a lot less intelligent that most of the people on the this forum. However, when I am interested in something I can run with it. I remember in high school I took some 3 credit computer courses, that had extra 1 credit modules that we could take. Me and a buddy were up to 7 credits in the first week of the course, and we spend the rest of our time getting high scores in space invaders (I won that one haha). The teacher eventually said we didn't need to bother showing up anymore, so we didn't. I ended up skipping probably half my classes by getting agreements from the teachers saying that I didn't need to show up. You need 100 credits to graduate high school, I finished with about 130 and had nearly the entire grade 12 off (aka drinking beer at friends houses instead)\n\nUnfortunately most school (especially at lower grades) don't let you have any freedom like that. You finish your work or are interested in something else and they force you into that box, and make you sit there doing literally nothing while the tards finish up. Gotta piss or are hungry? Wait your turn, wait until I say so, or just sit there and suck it up.\n\nYou are creative and have crazy dreams about the world? That is all madness and stop dreaming or thinking. You will be lucky to get a job working for someone else. Just sit there and do what we say, when we say it, and maybe you will graduate and \"better yourself\" at a university.\n\nI had the life thoroughly crushed out of me for such a long time. I was an enterprising young fellow who always ran little businesses and was the one who people went to to borrow money from. Then somewhere between high school and secondary education I had my dreams crushed completely out of me. It took me well into my 20's to start to even reclaim any of that. And now in my early 30's to finally get myself back. If I had even half the understanding at 20 that I do today.... wow. I think not being indoctrinated so much in my younger years would have really helped.\n\nI have no idea what I am going to do for education with my children when the time comes. But I do want to gather a group of like minded individuals, who have children roughly the same age, and figure something out together.

Parents would take their children's accomplishments and measure them up to others. Pretty unhealthy...a tough SCRIPT mechanism.\n\nSo, yes, I grew up having to give a shit on some things that might affect my performance ratings for my parents....\n\nI don't subscribe to that SCRIPT doctrine anymore. One good thing about it though, was that I worked and observed my a$$ off from an early age, regardless of whether comparing children with others was morally right or wrong. \n\nIt's somehow akin to learning a lot in jobs before you go out to start a Fastlane business.\n\nBTW, it's not romantic heroism to have a 'give a shit' mentality early in childhood. I paid very dearly for it.

The last thing any rich parent wants to do is stifle their kids, but most of them somehow do.Click to expand...\n\nSeconding this. I'm not a parent, but I ask the same questions.\n\nI have met several homeschooled families over the years. The interesting part is that they at least have their tires on the fastlane stripes or are completely in the fastlane.\n\n\nOne is a couple that met while he was doing music. Now he's an artist that runs his own shop. They homeschooled/went to montessori schools. They were incredibly talented, sharp, athletic, well-behaved kids that seemed born in the fast lane mentality\nAnother I met while they were figuring out their next business venture. They were living on a huge plot of land with extended family, coasting on savings and figuring out what they wanted to do. I didn't get the impression that they were loaded with money coming out of their ears, but they had enough of a cushion to relax, vacation and party while figuring out their brick and mortar venture\nYet another was one of the most genuinely positive, friendly, welcoming family I've ever met. They own a business that's somewhere in the 8-9 figure range. All of their kids are humble, great, intelligent, and light up the room. Yet they all stayed out of trouble with drugs and big problems whereas their extended family did not. Homeschooled. One of them attended a very specific private college that was known for not being like a typical party school\n\nThe upper middle class people, or the managerial class people that are still deep in the slow lane raise the most dangerous kids in my experience. I've seen them torn apart by drugs, attempted suicide, and massive entitlement.\n\nOne case in particular stands out. His father was pretty high up in management, but wanted his son to learn something about working. So he got his son hired at his local office. When his son was asked to do something at work:\n\"I don't have to do that because my dad's the boss\"\nHe later attempted to kill himself in a very ineffective way as a cry for help. He kind of pulled his life together a little bit, but then fell off the map.\n\nI think the people scampering for upper middle class have some kind of chip on their shoulder and something to prove, and have the means to spoil their children such that they never get the cold hit of reality until the damage has been done.", "My apologies for not kicking this off sooner... It turned out to be a much busier trip for me than anticipated.\n\nI am home now and I have unpacked some of my thoughts.\n\nSome of you may know that I am in the process of getting my pilot's license and this may be cheesy to some, but I am noticing a lot of parallels and analogies between the business world, as my limited experience can describe, and flight. The size of an airplane is like the size of our businesses.\n\nKnowledge- There is a tremendous difference in the amount of knowledge and experience required to be built up before you can fly a big jet... Some might say \"I don't have the experience or knowledge required to start a business like that\", but just like flight, you can learn. All the studying in the world, all the flying of Cessnas, is never going to prepare you to sit behind the controls of a jet. Pilots have to FLY a jet to learn a jet.\n\nNo one was born with the ability to fly a jet. Likewise no one was born with the ability to fly a Cessna either... The same goes for business. Folks will bitch about thinking big. \"Oh, I'll just \"do\" ecommerce for now until I build up some capital or experience\" It is a bullshit excuse. So you don't have the ability to set out to solve a legitimate problem, but you somehow have the ability to \"revoloutionize\" the cell phone case market with new color? No. Once again it comes back to becoming the expert. You must DO. You must ACT. There is NO ONE that will hold your hand and teach you how to start a seriously impactful business. Guess what... Thats OK! In fact it is real entrepreneurship. Following a step by step guide isn't. You'll F*cking crash.\n\nTake off- Quite simply put, the larger the plane, the more runway it normally needs to take off. While a tiny lightweight backcountry airplane can take off with almost no rollout, the large jets need thousands of feet to safely take off. This parallels with business because the larger the problem you are solving, the bigger the company it is anticipated to be, the longer it is going to take before it can transfer it's weight from the wheels to the wings.\n\nBarrier to entry? Yes. A jet needs a bigger runway... You can look at that runway as the blood, sweat and tears needed to be put in before your business can take off. Difficult is good for the people who have done it and bad for bozo wannabe competitors. This is the part where you LEARN! This is the part that builds you as a businessperson. This is the part that makes you EXPERIENCED. Have you ever wondered why some people get to the point where they don't feel the need to prove anything? Have you wondered why some people remain calm in the worst of times? They have been down a hell of a runway. The entrepreneur and the business is stronger for this.\n\nThis part goes along with my thread about what I would do if I started all over again. In that thread I basically make the case for a well capitalized business in order to ride out the run up first, and then climb faster. Need a bigger runway? OK... Build one.\n\nClimb out- Larger jets, once they are finished rolling out climb like crazy to altitudes you cant touch in a small piston airplane.\n\nThis is the day you realize you quite literally could disrupt an entire market. There are growing pains that are bigger than if you were a small business, but so what? Your idea paid off and you are filling the organizational holes with resources on your way up as you leave the small business concerns like getting the cheapest phone system, using your office depot coupons or renting the cheapest shit heap office space you can find in your dust. You have cashflow and cash balence to work out most of the pressing problems.\n\nCarrying capacity- I view this like a business' ability to carry resources. While a jet can carry hundreds of passengers, small airplanes have massive weight restrictions and fuel capacity considerations. With a smaller plane you need to make sacrifices in range to carry more weight and vice versa. Sound familiar?\n\nHow much inventory can you invest in at once? What kind of resources can your business carry? Can you afford a professional web designer or are you stuck trying your own hand? Can you afford to advertise to the extent you desire? Could your business accept a massive order without cashflow issues? How many ecommerce businesses could hire just one new person today and maintain a comfortable income for the proprietor? Some airplanes simply can't carry more than two or three people at a time, they are just too small and light. Everything in a small business is a trade off. Resources grow businesses.\n\nRough weather- It is inevitable that you will run into bad weather, the cool part is that jets fly over most of the bullshit. A small airplane can easily be murdered by the same storm a jet can simply fly over. Not only that, but a jet can intentionally fly through most shit that a small plane has to concern itself with. Small planes are constantly trying to avoid bad weather and adjust for changing conditions.\n\nWhat happens when marketplace policies change? What happens when advertising gets more expensive? What happens when taxes go up? What happens when you have a legal problem? The list goes on and on. Things that might simply shake a jet can rip the wings off a cessna.\n\nEase of operation- I don't think anyone would argue that with modern autopilots and avionics, a jet isn't a more pleasant aircraft to fly. They are, and they're less work. This is self explanatory. Look at a CEO of a company that employs just 20 people vs a onepreneur... The CEO looks at his business from 35 thousand feet and the onepreneur is probably at 5 getting hands dirty and worrying about navigating around the next dark cloud.\n\nWhat is my point?\n\nAll of this is not to say that you can't take a small company and turn it into a large company, but more often than not, the companies that become household names, the companies that employ 50, 1000, or even 100 thousand people are ones that were planned bigger from the start.\n\nI personally only give a damn about jets. Any Cessna stuff is a means to an end for me. You will see that my main businesses, as I progress and discuss them further, fit the criteria of the jet. Not because they grew into it, but because that is where I started them; despite some of the mistakes I've made and will discuss like trying to fly a \"jet\" off of a \"cessna\" runway.\n\nSorry if it's cheesy or elementary for some, but this is the kind of stuff that rolls through my head."], "Page12": ["Kak said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nSorry if it's cheesy or elementary for some, but this is the kind of stuff that rolls through my head.Click to expand...\n\nNot cheesy at all, it was a great analogy!\n\n\n\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\nToo many car analogies around here.

Namely, aiming higher than others thought possible and not being held back by arbitrary challenges.\n\nAt the time of writing, SCI has a 7.76 BILLION market cap. It started as a humble funeral business in Houston in 1962 (within our lifetime people) and has acquired competitors, growing to over 4,000 locations.\n\nWhat I love about this example is that it's a small family business that's scaled to a billion dollar company. People often have limiting beliefs around their niche i.e. \"well you can't get that big in my industry, we don't do (insert: AI, pharma, manufacturing, tech etc).\" This is funeral care people. It's incredibly limiting. You can't transfer bodies easily, people want it done locally so that can be nearby for ceremonies, it's human resource intensive etc. Yet they accomplished it.\n\nIt also happens to be a business model that I'm incredibly interested in. Solidifying a fragmented industry by buying out Mom and Pop stores that offer a fantastic service but without the skills to expand further, then keeping them on as management either through well-worded contracts or incentivizing by having them retain say 30%.\n\nWhat if you could do this in another industry? Roll-ups aren't incredibly uncommon, but I'm still surprised that more don't happen. Partly this is due to low investor appetite due to a few high profile failures like Valeant. Regardless, many companies have shown that this is a viable tactic.\n\nThink with more zero's and solve problems that other's haven't even though about.\n\nJust wanted to bump this thread for others to read and to try and provide a tiny bit of value myself.

What an elite group to aspire to.\n\nI had the opportunity to meet so many new and interesting people and still left unable to talk to all of you.    As has been overstated many times before, the takeaways that occur during the social events, and from the side discussions, are just as valuable as the content delivered from the speakers. \n\nI came away with a lot to think about, especially since my personal situation has changed drastically since last year's meetup.  I had a very different perspective going in this year.  If there was one theme that I could share with those that couldn't be there, one takeaway that resonated throughout most of the event, was that exceptional results are the outcome of exceptional action. Persistence in the face adversity, in lieu of pivoting or changing direction, achieved far greater results than ever expected by those who set out on their journeys.  Our speakers were exemplary representations of this as well. \n\nBest of luck to all of you looking to take action.

SO MUCH. Still going through my notes and trying to fix things in my mind. There was value and wonderfulness in each talk. It's crazy how useful each talk turns out to be, even when you don't think going in that it's going to be applicable. At this stage of the game, I feel like I can't afford to miss any of the talks.\n\nSome TRULY standout talks:\n\n@Boom: DUDE! You are the most REAL person that I've ever met. Loved your story and you had The Wife in tears listening to your Rags-to-Riches success story. You're the real deal. PHENOMENAL talk, and so chock-full of actionable/useful content that I'm still trying to unpack it all. Thanks for coming.\n\n@LightHouse: Dabbling is no longer a thing in this house, haha. GREAT talk. Really, man. Useful and just what I needed at this stage. I'll have to send you a gift certificate to Clown Depot as a way of saying thanks. \n\n@Travis Phipps : as always man, you give out SO MUCH value that it blows my mind. Seriously. You're the epitome of help first and the rewards will come. Folks, he's the REAL DEAL. Best story about competitive hijinks that I've ever heard.  Thanks for your help and advice and I can't wait to see what the future holds!\n\n@AllenCrawley: Gorgeous product, great story, and again, someone who gives away so much value that I feel guilty for receiving it. Thank YOU. \n\n@Envision: DUDE! 21 and already kicking a$$? Well done! And thank you for offering to help out my Son. That means a lot. You're going places. You're one of The Wife's fave people from the Meetup. \n\n@biophase: It was great to finally meet you in person. Thank you for keeping it real in the sea of hype. Tons of great tips, advice, and actionable info. And truly as nice in person as you are here on the forums.\n\n@GlobalWealth: Solid Gold, as always. This year we're in a better place to take advantage of your advice. Sorry that I had to run but we had a flight to catch. However, Lisbon looks like it could be a thing for us starting this summer. Thanks for opening our eyes. If you're ever in Texas let me know and we'll take you to dinner. I could have spent hours talking with you.

Thanks!\n\n@Sean Marshall: Yet another example of a \"No Excuses\" lifestyle. Thank you.\n\nEDIT: How could I forget @throttleforward !!? Bro! You'd better be franchising by next year!", "As far as global thoughts on the meetup:\n\n\nThere just ISN'T ENOUGH TIME. SERIOUSLY. I could have spent hours with just about everyone but it wasn't physically possible.\nWhat I took from this meeting was significantly different than what I took from last year's (my first). Yet it was still incredibly valuable. Over and over again I was reminded of my post in the \"MJ is giving out free Mentoring\" thread: You wouldn't even know what to DO with the information yet.\nThis year I was able to have conversations with @JasonR and others and actually understand and formulate a strategy to DO. Last year...I was kind of lost with the higher level stuff.\nThis year I lost my FEAR: That is, the Wife and I are mentally in a place to  TAKE ADVANTAGE of the advice/mentoring that we received from the last meetup.\n\nI can't imagine the Meetup getting any bigger. As it was, there were whole BLOCKS of people that I wanted to spend time with, but didn't have time to.\nTalking Stick was pretty cool. Bummer that the Pool was closed\nAlso, gambling addiction is a THING. UGH.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFolks, what I said at the meetup was true: You're on a high right now and it'll last about thirty days.\n\nThen.....nothing. You HAVE to, TODAY (!)\n\n- put into place a PLAN, SYSTEMS, and SITUATION (five closest people, living conditions, etc) to set yourself up for success. Don't be wallowing in a sea of Self Loathing come April or May.\n\n- Do it Now! Stick with it.\n\n- Get 2-4 others that you connected with, make a small accountability/MM group (use SLACK. Forget Skype for anything other than video chats) and get moving. Allow them to kick your a$$. You kick their asses. Be helpful. Maybe you'll become friends. \n\n- Destroy or get rid of: the TV, the XBox/PS4\n\n- Consider OUTSOURCING the stuff that you're not good at (painful lesson for me): Graphic arts, Photoshop, product photos (maybe), Website design, etc.\n\n- FOCUS on what you are/or should be good at: Biz plan, copywriting, strategic and tactical planning/execution for the business.\n\n- Workout, have fun, hike/bike, travel. It's not ALL grinding.\n\nBe ready to come back a year from now and talk about what you've done. Imagine how embarrassed you'll be if you sorta gave up. \n\nThe struggle is real. Life is real. Shit happens. But it's what we do when shit hits the fan that defines us. In business, in life, and in relationships.\n\nPeace", "To echo what's already been said, phenomenal job of putting on the event by @MJ DeMarco, @AllenCrawley , and @Red.\n\nI don't normally go to events like this (the last one was a Dan Kennedy event about 7-8 years ago and almost every presentation was a sales pitch for a backend product), but this event was NOTHING like that.  It was pure gold in every presentation.\n\nI am back home now sifting through my 40 pages of handwritten notes to put together a prioritized Execution list.\n\nI enjoyed meeting everyone I did, especially @Eskil , @Travis Phipps , @Vigilante , @throttleforward , @MustImprove , @Arrabista and many, many more.  And there are many more I never got the opportunity to speak to but will next year.\n\nThis event gave me a long to do-list for my current business, as well as ideas for new ones.  Most importantly, it crystallized and clarified my thinking in a few areas that I now realize I have been holding myself back. \n\nOne last thing to echo what was said about cold calling at the end in the panel.  Although I agree with @MJ DeMarco that \"cold calling sucks\", it is definitely something that needs to be tried in your business as it's always worked extremely well in mine (B2B reaching Directors, VP & C-level).  But if your perception of cold calling is to make a sale cold to a cold prospect on the phone, it can be brutal.\n\nHowever, cold calling does indeed work well if you:\n\na) have a very well thought out and researched list of prospects who already are clients of your type of service but currently use a competitor\nb) the value of each sale is high - anything in the mid to high 4 figures and up is excellent for this.\nc) you use the cold call as the 1st step of a multi-step process - ie you call to get a face to face appointment, NOT to make a sale \n\nLastly, someone mention the book Predictable Revenue.  Excellent book, however if you are trying to sell in Canada using this method, be very careful with the CASL (Canadian Anti-SPAM) legislation that went into effect July 1, 2014 as it prohibits this practice with severe penalties.  I reached out to the author Aaron Ross on this 2 years ago and he wasn't totally sure and agreed that there were a lot of grey areas with it.\n\nAmazing job by all presenters and I will definitely be back next year.", "What a weekend!!!\n\nSo happy I got to meet nearly everyone there. I think there were a few that escaped me. Intentional? \n\nIf it wasn't for @Red these events wouldn't go so smoothly. From the planning, the scheduling and her bull dogged tenacity and ability to Get Sh!t Done. (After hearing her presentation it's no wonder.)\n\nShout out to @BaraQueenbee for keeping me caffeinated. You did a fantastic job running the Bulletproof Coffee station and I'm so happy to have meet you. Thank you @Eskil for helping us to identify each other quickly with just a glance. Thank you @thorn for creating the eye pleasing itinerary.\n\nI'd like to personally thank a few people that took the time over the weekend to help enrich my business by either sharing their contacts, talents, insights, advice, expertise or audience.

The great speakers, the camaraderie, the intoxicating energy of the venue, it was truly an event I will remember forever -- and look forward to next year.\n\nEven as the event grew larger this year (about 60% larger over last) there was still an incredible bond between the group.  The side conversations, the fireside chats, the cigar pit stories; as I rolled out of the casino and climbed into my car, I felt like I was saying leaving a family behind.\n\nA huge, special thanks to @Red for making this happen -- because of her, we got to rock this event in a venue teeming with activity, energy, and activities.  Just several years ago this thing was held in a decrepit Days Inn.  On top of this, her presentation was a invaluable exercise into how to get things done with the event itself exemplifying it successful execution.  \n\nAdditional thanks go to @AllenCrawley who seriously might have a second career in emceeing.

Many thanks have already been posted to all the speakers and I'd like to echo those thanks once again. \n\nI was expecting to be able to put faces with forum names and maybe learn about others businesses with some superficial depth. But I wasn't expecting what unfolded. I have been surprised by the depth of the relationships formed and that businesses were discussed.

It first started with @JonnyC and @NYCGoblin at the airport and didn't let up.  \n\nBefore I left I challenged @throttleforward to post an INE of his own as he pursues his current path. I look forward to his post and to hear his update next year. He in turn challenged me to exercise one of his suggestions about giving free marketing advice to someone 'cold'. I'm not a digital marketer but I may be at some point in the distant future, so challenge accepted! \n\n@Boom I just finished listening to your CDs as I wait for my flight. Thank you for this gift.

I don't get to meet like minded individuals who can help me blow my business up, with just a few words of advice.\n\nI would like to do a longer follow up post, where I list some of the specifics that helped me...from each speaker and from each conversation (this will be a daunting task, but it might be fun).\n\nLet me tell you a \"True Story\".  This event in 2015 was largely responsible for a HUGE boost in my business last year.  When I say HUGE, I mean think 100% growth.  I can't attribute all of that growth to the meetup, but it may very well be responsible for 75% of that growth.  I'm a numbers guy and an objective guy...so, I had to throw that out there.  Because I believe that a lot of people see these events as a good for \"networking\" or getting some good \"advice\" or \"inspiration\".  Don't get me wrong...it is awesome for those things, but if you implement just one or two things you pick up this conference...it can be life changing...\n\nThere aren't enough like buttons, or shout-outs I can give.

I have been to this event every year since I've been on the forum (7 or 8 years?).  Every year this event just keeps getting better and better.  It's really hard to explain to people the value from this event, but for me this is a must attend every year.  I know people have personal issues that pop up, but I honestly cannot imagine anything that would prevent me from attending every year. \nI remember the days of listening to 4 presentations on photography, and yet there was still tremendous value to be had.  Now the events is exponentially better than the old days.\n\n@Arrabista you always amaze me.  I love that we've been leading with you.  Just that scheduling choice improves my own presentation.  You have helped me greatly in presentation and communication skills.\n\n@Kung Fu Steve You kicked my a$$.  You are all too familiar with the shit I have been dealing with the past couple of years and watching your presentation discussing the feedback loop slapped me in the face.  I needed it.  This was the best presentation you've ever given.\n\n@splok Your presentation is always one of my favorites.  Your subtle humor and style are fantastic.  I would imagine your students love you.\n\n@Red I learning a lot about just digging in and getting my hands dirty about doing research to get what you want.  I have done this a few times myself, but not at the depth you have clearly gone to.  And it would be nice to stop showing my boobs for traffic stops.

As you know I am in process with launching a product and your presentation offered enormous value and great ideas on how to get this off the ground.\n\n@MJ DeMarco I am very glad to see you take over the branding of this event and control the content.

Don't dabble (credit @LightHouse I believe). Go into a market full throttle with full intent on making it work and making a big splash.\n-It's generally better to enter a market that has competition because competition means demand, then it's a matter of taking a portion of that market. My biggest mistakes in the past have been entering into small demand areas with little to no competition. Start with the need! The need comes first!\n-The ones who put in the most effort are the one's who will be the most successful. Most people are looking for the shortcut. The obstacle is the opportunity.\n-The more value you offer the customer (and showing it in your marketing and product copy), the more your product will seem like the correct choice over other products.\n-When accomplishing a goal or task requires the cooperation of a company, start with the people who can say yes. Gatekeepers are trained to say \"no\".\n\nI will leave you with this...", "Wow.

On the journey home, it was really clear this meetup was well worth it for both of us, and our respective businesses.\n\nThe only real downside is the emotional drain we both felt as we had to leave.  It really was like leaving family.  Even going to bed every night during the meetup was difficult, because we didn\u2019t want to leave the conversation, the camaraderie and the knawledge.\n\nThe crazy thing is that most people we chatted with were people we met for the first time.  Some of my best friends from this forum and meetup are those I have only met in person for a few hours or days.  But the impact on my life, and my family\u2019s life, is pivotal.  I can\u2019t thank you all enough.\n\nBut I\u2019d like to specifically call out:\n\n@MJ DeMarco Thanks for creating this awesome forum and the book that changed both my life and the trajectory of my family.  This is something I haven\u2019t said enough, and can\u2019t really be said enough.\n\n@Red Thanks for planning the whole damned thing.  I\u2019ve planned events not even 1/10th the size of this thing, and it was hard as hell; you\u2019ve done something amazing here.\n\n@LightHouse Thanks a F*ckton for convincing me to come this year.  I almost didn\u2019t come.  Not coming would have been a big mistake. Your talk has changed the way I look at every action I take.  \"Don\u2019t dabble\" hits home.\n\n@1step  If nothing else, this meetup was just a great excuse to finally meet up with you again in person. When I heard how awesome you did this year, all I could say was how proud I am of your achievements and the freedom you\u2019ve secured for yourself \u2013 it inspires me more than almost anything else.\n\n@TheSilverSpoon I can\u2019t believe what one year has done!  From affiliate marketing struggles to software development and arbitrage success, your story has been crazy and I hope I can continue to help you this year as you continue to progress.\n\n@biophase Your talk had the most impact on me.  There were so many golden nuggets: experience life to find problems; research the shit out of your competitors; embrace the barriers to entry; give consistent, constant effort.  I can\u2019t thank you enough for the perspective.\n\n@Envision Your presentation was incredible.  Like so many other talks, you made me realize how even when I was running myself into the ground overworking myself, I wasn\u2019t hustling.  You define the hustle, have found ways to build an incredible network and take on life without letting anything hold you back.  Even though I am over 11 years your senior, I have so much to learn from you.\n\n@Kung Fu Steve  It was incredibly awesome and inspirational to hear you speak and finally meet you.  The world of self-help is flooded with bullshit artists, but you\u2019re not one of them and it\u2019s really refreshing.\n\n@kamanuci & @GIlman - Thanks a ton for shedding even more light on how to hire people to get the job done right.  My hiring efforts in the past have been lukewarm at best, and you made me see the dozens of ways that I was the problem and can hire better.  That\u2019s my first priority this year.\n\n@GIlman - Special shoutout to you as we share a common thread in software.  Seeing another software guy in this group who has an amazing plan, an amazing background and an amazing business model has been truly inspirational \u2013 even more this year than last year.\n\n@thorn - Thanks a ton for sharing your story with me on the first day.  Your story has really opened my eyes to the opportunities the hustle can bring, the importance of never being satisfied and how to ensure you have passion in your business.\n\n@throttleforward - In Alexandria you told me you were embarrassed to present about your \u201clittle bullshit company\u201d (or something similar), but your story is incredibly inspiring. Your ability to do this while having a demanding full time job, doing consulting and taking care of your family shows me how much more I am capable of, too.\n\n@Arrabista - I can\u2019t believe I only met you twice.  Thank you for making my wife and I feel incredibly welcome and at home in the tribe.  It\u2019s always inspirational to hear your adventures through the year, and the business opportunities you\u2019re pursuing.\n\n@Vigilante - Your perspectives on crafting business deals and balancing all of the variables at once was enlightening.  The fear of non-delivery is still strong with me, despite how hard I work to overcome it. You\u2019ve made me realize it\u2019s a fear worth overcoming.\n\n@Boom - Thanks for sharing your story, struggle, and journey.  It was eye opening that no matter where you come from, no matter what shit we go through, success is there if we decide to choose it.\n\n@Sean Marshall  - The journey you and your wife have gone through is similar to ours, and you\u2019ve given me a new way to think about living life to the fullest as an entrepreneur with a family.  It\u2019s a lesson for which I am truly grateful.\n\n@JonnyC - Your story was like hearing a case study of the amazing advice @biophase laid out in his talk.  It\u2019s incredible what you\u2019ve done so far, and I am glad we were able to have a chance meeting so that I could hear your story just before you left.\n\nI still haven\u2019t thanked everyone who had a huge impact on me this year.  If your name isn\u2019t on here, chances are it should be - and I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t type it all out!\n\nBut all this is nothing without action and execution - so I've got my big rocks to tackle.\nReady. Go!", "Man, I dont even know where to begin and there's way too much i could say. I reread the book on the plane ride home and reset everything I intend to do in 2016. You all made me realize I wasn't pushing myself enough.\n\nThank you to @MJ DeMarco and @Red for putting on such a great event and thank you to all of the speakers who provided so much value and blew my mind with what they have done and are doing. I'm still going through notes and applying everything. The best part about this was all of the people that I got the chance to meet and the conversations that were had, everyone was so cool and down to earth I can't wait to see you all again next year. \n\nAnd thank you to @Vigilante for your motivating words after my speech. I didn't get a chance to thank you and talk to you as much as I'd like to. But it meant a lot and it lit a fire inside me. Thank you.\n\nI feel like this whole event unlocked a part of my brain, that was me holding myself back. Some bullshit beliefs I created a long time ago still lingered in my head before and now their gone. \n\nI'll see you all again soon!\n\n\"Don't dabble, don't F*ck around. Just work and execute.\"", "Well I can't add too much to what has been said other than it is all true. It is very hard for me to get away (business/family) but thanks to a great spouse was able to make it. It was an incredible event. \n\nOne major great thing about this event that cannot be stressed enough is that MJ does not desire to be a guru. If anyone has ever attended real estate/personal development events you know that even if you feel like you are getting value the event serves primarily to upsell something to you. Free event/$1000 event/10,000 event/40,000event. I have attended a few 1000 dollar events for real estate because I absolutely love real estate and while I learned a few things it was nothing like the fastlane summit. At the risk of sounding arrogant or like a snob I didn't meet one person that I would want to continue staying in contact with. Why? Because almost everyone there thought they needed a guru to give them all the answers. The tone of the Summit is so completely different. From the official greeting, \"What are you working on?\" to people buying gumball machines it is truly the coolest most amazing group of people. \n\nThanks to MJ and Red for organizing and setting up. Thanks to Allen for MCing and not only to all the speakers but all the attendees. I will be hiring 10 VA's to all be sitting on a computer madly clicking to get a ticket next year. \n\nRemember never accept a no from someone who can't give you a yes.", "Had a serious conversation with my wife.

When you get older, the more time seems to fly\u2026.don\u2019t I repeat, DON\u2019T look back and worry about the years wasted.  Take stock in the years you have left.\n\nBeing fairly new to all this, just finding out and joining the forum last October, I didn\u2019t know the concept of a fast lane business, or really put much thought into the time vs. money thing.  To me, that was just a concept I blew off as just so much Amway MLM type crap, which I had tried years ago.\n\nI just figured one would need to have a regular business, work your a$$ off and trade your product/services for money as it relates to the time and effort one puts into it.

Who cares?  Every dollar more you earn as a result of the information gained from this summit, is a dollar you never would have earned by not putting the information to use.\n\nYou\u2019ll see in the photo, the slow lane business of mine, the stack of boxes after a trip to my mailbox and the resulting work waiting for me upon my return to Colorado late Monday night.  I\u2019m fortunate though.  A lot of people in slow lane business would panic at the thought of taking a few days away from their businesses.\n\nWell, time to get back at it and get caught up with this.

It was as if I've known you guys/gals my whole life.\n\nI didn't want to leave...\n\n\nI'll buy my 2017 Fastlane Summit ticket today if can.\n\nThanks @MJ DeMarco @Red  and everyone else involved with making this event happen.", "Vigilante said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nCurse you @Kung Fu Steve.

Scary even for me.\n\n[HASHTAG]#ThisIsOurTime[/HASHTAG]Click to expand...\n\nA goal should scare you a little... and excite you a lot!\n\nI'm in the same boat, my friend.\n\nBig goals -- but nothing that someone hasn't done before us. In fact, people who were worse off than us, not as smart as us, and CERTAINLY not as good looking as us ;-)", "So I'm already back to the grind and working nights, but I thought that I would add some additional thoughts:\n\n* I came out of this year's meetup feeling differently than last year. \n\nLast year, I was all fired up with the burning desire to DO SOMETHING and The Wife and I had a BIG IDEA but little idea of how to achieve that goal in detail.\n\n* THIS year, we came to the meetup knowing that there were certain things that HAD TO BE DONE (Paid traffic, AMZ optimization, poss affiliate marketing) but unsure of the direction to go first, and how to execute.\n\nWell...it's safe to say that we learned the HOW of execution (or at least, what are the actionable next steps) and we've already started moving forward. I've got boxes of product just about ready to go to Amazon's FBA warehouse. The Wife is giving me good feedback about site improvements & brand development/refinement (I've been a solo show for months). We're hiring a graphic designer to re-do the site. Thanks to @JasonR for the awesome AMZ marketing hack discussions, and for convos with You Know Who about affiliate marketing.\n\nin short, we're thinking BIG this year. \n\nThere's a BIG number that we're reaching for by 31 Dec.\n\nA CRAZY Number. But @Kung Fu Steve ....I've got my hand out and I'm grabbing that GOAL with both hands. Thanks man.\n\n==========================\n\nAlso want thank EVERYONE whom I talked to at the meetup. I never did have enough time and it was humbling to meet so many thoughtful, supportive, ACCOMPLISHED, and HUMBLE individuals. If there was a pill that allowed one to forgo sleep for three days so that I could continue to talk with everyone......\n\n\n\n*cough* Modafinil *cough*", "** One other note: I thought that I knew what giving value meant before this weekend.\n\nI was not even CLOSE.

Thanks y'all."], "Page13": ["After missing classes and exams coming up, I finally had time to edit the clips I took of the event and put them together. It is not the best edited video but hope you guys enjoy it.\n\n\n\n\nMan oh man, I met so many great people! I was so nervous coming to the meet up not knowing anyone, but everybody was so open. I felt like I wouldn\u2019t connect to many people because I am still a college student trying to figure out my path to the fastlane. In fact, EVERY conversation I had there was amazing advice and everyone was so positive. Even when I was just sitting around a group and listening to people talk, it provided so much value.\n\n\nIt was awesome meeting people with the same mentality, I rarely find people with the same mindset back home. It was incredible meeting a huge group of people with the same mindset all at once. The meetup showed me reality. Anyone can achieve freedom if they put the effort and provide value to others. It is significantly different going to the meet up and talking with people that post on the forum compared to reading the threads/post on the forum.\n\n\n\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\n\nThank you to all the speakers, each and every one of you provided so much value.

The reason i say that is because my friends have become family and family will make you unstoppable.\n\nThis year I learned more about myself, my environments, my patterns, and my growth than i could have ever imagined possible.\n\nI could go on and on, but let me thank a handful of folks first;\n\nEvent\n\n\n@MJ DeMarco - Thank you for watching my preso this year\u2026 i know it was difficult, but you made it and we are proud  You have built an amazing community of people that will long outlast any expectation you\u2019ve had. I remember having a conversation at some point and you alluded that you weren't that big a deal\u2026 and someone looked at the huge crowd on the patio and simply said rhetorically...\u201call these people aren\u2019t here because of you?\u201d\n\n(p.s. Next year i\u2019m going before you again and giving out a $100)\n\n@Red  - I know event coordination is not easy, but man you sure make it seem so. Every point of the summit this year was incredibly seamless. The hands free mic, the clicker\u2026 all that little stuff made a huge impact on how well the preso\u2019s were presented. Great job, great preso, you are amazing!\n\n\n@AllenCrawley  - Not only are you an amazing father and dad, but damn you know how to MC! The intro\u2019s were a great segway into the speakers this year, and you even left @vigilante\u2019s out to make him sweat\u2026 true hero  I love where your company is going, I actually show off your marketing photos often. Can\u2019t wait to see what you do after your first Million this year.\n\n\n\nFriends\n\n\n@Karen  - Thanks for grabbing me for wadihs demonstration, i never knew i was a pleasant F*cker, most people never add that extra bit in the front. I love what you and Tim are building, I can\u2019t wait to see how it pans out with building your team in Berlin. (I dont know Tim\u2019s forum name to tag him)\n\n\n@Boom - My dude! I talked you up a ton this year, and you delivered hard. Thank god you didn\u2019t F*ck it all up like 4 years ago  Your drive to grow and just get things done is inspiring, I am glad you are selling off the extra weight and zoning in on Savvy, I think you will continue to crush it there. I look forward to watching that progress and seeing your youngin\u2019s grow to be as determined as their dad. I also think gumball machines would be a good investment now, I\u2019ve always been interested in making tens of quarters a day \n\n\n@jaykla  (Jay K) - Jay it was great to see you again, and actually meet your brother and two little ones. I hope they had fun at the arcade with 2 machines in it. I don\u2019t think I have ever been so far off in an intro to someone. That means we haven\u2019t stayed connected enough to know what is going on, let\u2019s change that! I want to hear more about the new practice you are running.\n\n\n@Travis Phipps  - Travis it was great seeing you again. I am glad you have been coming every year to let loose some of your knowledge. I hope you write that book i requested (LOL) you have atleast 2 buyers because Dave will buy it for sure if i actually think something is worth the money to pay for. In fact, Dave will buy both of ours\u2026 right @Vigilante? [I know you would have at least 20-30 buyers right off the bat, btw. I\u2019ll help drum that up if you need me too]\n\n\n[USER=8814]@AnneC[/USER]  @ john @ kevin - I love seeing you guys all the time, every time i see you it is seriously like seeing distant family. I wish i had had more time to chat with you guys, but we will get together somewhere later this year. I owe it to you @Anne for telling me to step up last year. That drove me most of the year to have something to talk about this year.\n\n\n@Eskil  - I know we talk often but thank you for the advice on the plastic injection molding and letting everyone get a deep dive into your process. It is invaluable to me as well as many others to me able to see the side of things that you don\u2019t get to normally. I have a ton of notes from your Preso i still have to re-review as well\n\n\n@irishmickk  - Mike you amaze me with what you\u2019ve built, captivating an entire market in a country is no easy feat esp with your products. I will follow up with you here soon to see how i can help accelerate your process. I can see you being on the speaker list next year, without contest. Thanks for making the leap over the pond so we could all meet you!\n\n\n@theferrariboy  -  I know we didn\u2019t get much time to chat, but we will in april. See you at Wavedaze, start saving your change now, or plan to sell that car cause you are going to want a $40k 250 lb toy after that.\n\n\n@EvanOkanagan -  It was great seeing you again. Loved hearing the story about your events last year. Glad i got to expand on the last memory i had of you lifting people up at the bar for sport. You are going to crush it as Partner for your firm.\n\n\n@Milkanic -  Great seeing you again as always, we never get enough time to put our technical knowledge together but that might be a good thing! I hope you have your breakout year this year.\n\n\n@Envision (roc) -  I think you inspired a lot of people this year Roc. You are the only eprson I know that has literally 0 excuse not to me worth millions in a few short years. You know what you need to do, get to work and don\u2019t stop. You\u2019ve accomplished far more than most in such a short time, so go get the rest of it. I know you can do it!\n\n\n@1step - As always it was good hanging out, I know we chat often. I didn\u2019t get to thank you for getting my project last year jump started. You were a huge help in that and I owe you a ton of gratitude. Can wait to see how this year goes for you since you are going to 2x. (and yes, some of us extroverts need breaks too )\n\n\n@Hong King Kong  - [HASHTAG]#Wedemboyz[/HASHTAG] - You are getting ready to crush everyone with the end of your KS campaign, yet you still got time for us little guys doing weird dances at the multi-cultrual club. You are awesome dude, can\u2019t wait to see what this year brings for you!\n\n\n@OperationMyWay - Kyle it sucks we didn\u2019t get much time together this year, we will catch up soon though, this is your year to jump in both feet forward. I am there as a resource if you need me, you know that!\n\n\n@Kreedos Phoenix - It was great meeting you and your girl. She is hilarious but i still want to know what she meant by \u201cya\u2019ll aint from around here!\u201d  You guys are hilarious!\n\n\n@BaraQueenbee - I am surprised at your drive and your charisma. Thanks for keeping all our frineds and family caffineted, im sorry we didn\u2019t get to chat more, i told you it\u2019d be second best \n\n\n\n@Morethan1 (alex) - Alex thanks for your offer for help on some of the plastic stuff i need to know, as soon as i start settling I will reach out to you. I never thought i could chat with someone as smart as you!\n\n\n@Jamie T - I am glad you came and i\u2019m glad i had the chance to meet you. But more than anything, thanks for bringing house coffee when we needed it most. It shows huge character thinking about everyone around you. I cant wait to learn more about your story!\n\n\n@SK2kev - You and your partner are rock solid dudes, i told someone i regretted not having more time to talk with you guys. I feel like we could all hang out at a bar for hours on end. I hope to learn more about ya\u2019lls business over the next year and provide help if i can.\n\n\n@MacApple (jay) - I hope all those trays got picked up and you have a new direction now. You and your wife are awesome. I\u2019m disappointed im not the best looking dude in the room anymore, some say that stopped a long time ago but i think it was just until this year  You are set to do some great things this year dude!\n\n\n@GIlman - We have still avoided spending some serious chat time together, I loved your preso this year. I took a ton of notes i still have yet to analyze, i hope to do that soon and implement your vast array of knowledge.\n\n\n@exclusives88 (Mike) - It was great meeting you, the new watches look awesome. I\u2019ll be ordering one sometime soon to add to my collection. Let me know when you get back in our area so we can meet up!\n\n\n@MikeC - No amazing intros this year, but no wrecking house with terrible lines either. Keep being MikeC and I will keep anticipating what\u2019s next.\n\n\n@danoodle - I am glad to say there were no midgets or bronies this year. Your new baby is beautiful and I think it\u2019s made you a better man. I am glad you\u2019ve come and grown with us every year.\n\n\n@Iwokeup  - Pete, im so excited to see this new product line explode, i think you are primed and this weekend ignited your fire. You have my info if you need help, just hit green!\n\n\n@Sauce  - My chat with you was actually the most notable discussion i had all weekend. The fact that you were vulnerable and transparent to someone you didn't know says huge things about your character. I hope the feedback you didn\u2019t ask for (lol) was beneficial. If you need to talk, msg me!\n\n\n@Chitown  - My dude, you are on a breakout this year. You are the most likable charismatic dude i know. After i chat with you I feel like i have a lot more i could be doing making others feel amazing, much the same way you do. Keep in touch this year, don\u2019t F*ck that up! \n\n\n@K.Y.  - You know you inspire  me like crazy. One of the biggest take aways i had this weekend is how present you and byron were during Monday night dinner. crush it this year.\n\n\n@saigon  (byron) - As i said above, you taught me something about being ultra present when you are with people. I love that and i am working to improve. I think you are going to make big waves this year, and I am here if you need help along the way.\n\n\n@csalvato  - I am glad you had the opportunity open up to come. It was great to finally meet Serena and Mia. Your daughter is absolutely gorgeous. You are making me re-think never taking vacations too, I might have to change that this year!\n\n\nFamily\n\n\n@throttleforward  - dude, I can\u2019t explain to you how impressed I am with you and your preso this year. I\u2019ve watched you build this biz and seen the struggle. To finally get validation, get the fire lit and then on top throw out the job and everything\u2026 I am so enamoured with everything you are doing. Truly truly impressive Adam, I am glad i get to see it all first hand.\n\n\n@Likwid24 - \u201cI got thesee cheezbouygas\u201d I am so glad you made it out this year. I am sure Boris has a great time massaging your legs while you were sick on Sunday too. I can\u2019t wait to see the things you and Likwid accomplish. I\u2019ll be there if you need me!\n\n\n@biophase  - I know we didn\u2019t get a ton of time to chat this year in person but thanks for all the guidance you have given me. It\u2019s always inspiring learning from KSB\u2026 i just wish KSB knew more about KSB so KSB could be taught.\n\n\n@Vigilante  - I am so glad you made it this year, i didn\u2019t know you were such a big eminem fan, i thought you lost those CD\u2019s along with your truck  I think the fire you have in you is inspiring a lot of people including me right now. Thanks for taking my call early last year, you set me on a whole new path!\n\n\n@TheTruth  - Boris, I love you bro. Although i\u2019m sliding on your moral compass, i truly appreciate you in my life. The story of you shedding everything has made me re-think a lot of things and how i operate. I hope we have more chances to actually get together this year outside of whatsapp\n\n\n@JasonR  - Words can\u2019t express my gratitude for you this year. Not only do you care about the things that are core to me, but you were there when i needed you so many times in a short period. I wish i travelled as much as you do and we could have more weekends like that. I think you are going to double up in the next few months and crush it, you know i\u2019ll be there to help where I can.\n\n\n@GlobalWealth  - Looking beyond my endless bouts of jokes to your demise, you showed me a level of friendship this year that most will never achieve. I really appreciate your drive and care for what happens in my life and how it affects everything. Even at times when i\u2019ve been defensive, know I am still thinking about it days later and working on applying it. Thank you so much for caring. ( i almost choked writing that, but it certainly wasn\u2019t because of you\u2026. sigh)\n\n\n@Kung Fu Steve  - My main man. Not many people say they have a Personal development coach in their life, none the less on tap when needed most. The things that you taught me this weekend both personal and professional were monumental to me. It\u2019s things that are already having change and will having lasting change for the rest of my life. Not just on me, but also everyone around me. Your story is truley amazing and I am really grateful to be apart  of it.\n\n\nI had conversations with a lot of you that i can\u2019t quite put a forum name too. I was hoping to connect with more folks this year but getting sick on sunday crushed all of that. I think this years group was amazing and the entire event was life changing as it always is. I love all my new friends.\n\nParting note...

I have used eLance, LinkedIn and various .ph websites.\n\nBy using his specific process to drill down and find people on Upwork, we very quickly found an excellent part-time resource with a lot of experience to help us out on the admin side.  I spent 1.5 hours with her on the phone 2 days ago and she is already up to speed and productive within 24 hrs.  She has already taken 1 very time-consuming process off of our plate that requires her calling contacts live and filling out a document.

So I do quick math in my head - 20 appts a day, say 50% show - that's 10 x $10 US = $100 US bonus PER DAY x 5 days is $500 US per week or around 20,000 pesos per week over and above his 4500 per week.  I told him there is no way he is making 100,000 pesos a month to book meetings for applicants.\n\nSo I asked him how much he got paid last week - he said 5300 - 4500 base plus 800 pesos bonus which translates to TWO people actually showing up.

I am here to dispel those myths and correct the misinformation that I see being published daily in business forums.\n\nA bold claim?

My first job after college was with a big shipping company. Eleven years after I started that first business in 1967 I began exporting my products to Asia/Pacific countries including China which I have visited on countless occasions.\n\nAfter selling that business in 1987 I began importing from countries including China, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Brazil. This new business sold products B2B. I had no retail sales. Business boomed and soon I ran out of family members to employ, so I expanded by selling franchises until I had franchisees operating my importing business in 4 countries.\n\n\n\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\nHeart surgery a few years ago forced me to sell that business but my brain won\u2019t slow down so I wrote my book and am now having more fun than ever helping new entrepreneurs get a safe start into importing.\n\nFire away with your questions.\n\nEDIT: This is a long running thread and product sourcing and importing is always subject to changing conditions.

Don't try to export direct to commercial end users. A good agent will have \"cousins\" in business and that can be the start of a good network.\n\nWhen importing from Asia Pacific countries carefully attend to due diligence. Part of the need for this is cultural differences. For example Chinese business people will rarely say no. If they say yes, it could mean maybe, possibly, no, or even yes. Because they sometimes say yes when they should say no, don't be annoyed, just frame your question so that a yes or no answer is not required.\nGet everything in writing. Dot every i and cross every t, so that there can be no misunderstandings.\nImporting from Asia Pacific countries is easy once you understand the process, but exporting to those countries can be hard work even when you do understand.

Here is what I posted yesterday on another thread:\n\nLack of response is common when newbies communicate with suppliers on any B2B platform.

They think a) Another opportunist looking for freebies, or b) This person is going to need too much help.\n\nTo help your chances of getting a reply, newbies should follow these rules:\n\nRemember, it is not so much a matter of what to say, as what not to say.\n\nDon't mention that you are new to the business.\nDon't tell them you are a sole trader.\nDon't offer your business plan like you would to a supplier in the USA.\nDon't ask what is their MOQ.

Most \"experts\" will tell you to do so, but there are good reasons why you should not and I teach why you don't need to. This issue is even more critical in the early stages. If you try to talk the price down early on you will suddenly find no more emails arrive.\nThere are a few things you should say:\n\nTell them you are an established importer.\nTell them quality is important to you.\nAsk them for a copy of their catalog, preferably a printed version.\nGive them your business name.

If you like the product well enough, when placing your next order I would insist upon a smaller upfront deposit with the balance payable on proof of dispatch. \n\nIf you begin dealing with other suppliers in future, one of the best tips I can offer is to communicate with them frequently before placing an order, and see how quickly they respond. Slow responses on the sales side of things are a warning sign. If you order a sample and it is slow coming that is a bad sign also. I would also try to negotiate a smaller deposit from the outset.\n\nWalter", "Some things you should know or do before you start product sourcing.\n\n\nDo your market research. Work out what to sell, how to sell it, and what prices you can confidently expect to sell it for. That confidence must be based on thorough research, not just checking sold prices on eBay. Determine what maximum landed cost is affordable in order to be competitive and profitable, making sure you take into account all selling costs.\n\nYou should not be put off by stories about the complexities of importing. It is possible to simplify the importing process and you don\u2019t have to learn all the rules and regulations\n\nNot understanding freight can lead to costly problems so you must learn the meaning of freight terms. If you don\u2019t know anything about shipping bulky lightweight goods, don\u2019t consider such products without a lot of research on freight implications.\n\nIt is important to know the difference between air freight and air courier services. Air freight should be arranged through a freight forwarder, but air courier shipments can be handled by your supplier. Get all your freight quotes in writing.\n\nInternational trade uses standard terms known as INCOTERMS. You can find them on Wikipedia. One term that is commonly misunderstood or misused is FOB. Officially it relates only to sea freight, but in China it is very often used in relation to air freight or air courier shipments. It means that the supplier bears all costs to the point where the goods are loaded on board the carrier\u2019s transport.\n\nUnfortunately many Chinese companies quote FOB when they really mean EXW. That stands for Ex Works. This is one reason why you must get freight quotes in writing and they must include everything. For example if your supplier has a factory in Shenzhen and quotes FOB Shenzhen, that might lead you to think he will bear all costs until the goods are loaded on board a vessel in Shenzhen harbour. It should, but unless he has confirmed that in writing, he may mean FOB his loading dock, which amounts to EXW and you will have to bear costs of transport to the harbour, wharf cost, export clearance cost, and handling charges.\n\nIf you think that getting an exclusive agency is the best model, you need to understand agencies and distributorships. Such arrangements with suppliers in China are rarely achieved.  If a Chinese company agrees to an exclusive agency or distributorship it will involve a very substantial initial purchase and you should be aware that they may open their own office in your country if your sales are good, and you are left out of the picture.\n\nStandards. Does your product have to comply? You can find out by asking an appropriately qualified Customs broker.\n\nBefore starting to send out inquiries to suppliers, get a disposable email address. When your inbox gets swamped as it inevitably will, you then change to a different address.\n\nFree samples may be available but you will have to pay freight. When asked to supply your courier account number, tell them that you have found deliveries via the postal service from China (or HK) to be very satisfactory so please use that service and you will prepay the postal charges.\n\nDon\u2019t be put off by the huge MOQs that are usually quoted. They are negotiable, but don\u2019t ask what their MOQ is. Don\u2019t try to negotiate a smaller order until you have communicated with them for several weeks.\n\nDo not haggle. I know many \u201cexperts\u201d will tell you to do this but Chinese business people will be offended if you do it. It may be OK at street markets but not for serious business.\n\nIt is essential that you calculate actual costs before you place an order. Think of every possible cost and work out your landed cost. Here are some things to consider: Purchase cost, freight, Customs Broker or Freight Forwarder fees, Insurance, Duty, Sales Tax, freight to your location. Don\u2019t forget when calculating duty and tax for yourself that it is always calculated on the total of Cost of Goods + Freight.", "Walter Hay said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nDon\u2019t forget when calculating duty and tax for yourself that it is always calculated on the total of Cost of Goods + Freight.Click to expand...\n\nI don't think I've ever had freight included in my duty costs??", "We don't pay duty on freight.

That way you will almost always avoid paying duty on the freight component of your cost unless your forwarder declares it in the Customs clearance process, which strictly speaking is what should be done. \n\nIt is also possible that Customs will estimate a freight figure. They have legal powers that entitle them to make such estimates. They will even estimate the value of the goods if they doubt the veracity of the declared value. Unless the amounts are huge, challenging such estimates can be a very time consuming and costly business that will usually prove not worth it.\n\nWalter", "Phones said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nIn European Union you pay VAT/Duty over the Total Value of the Shipment (Value of goods + Shipment).

Liquids, are another bad item to import, in terms of shipping. Things that are fragile as well (coffee mugs) and defense items (swiss army knife, brass knuckles, you get the idea). Defense items are more so difficult with the customs side of things, from my understanding.\n\nWith that being said, you have to be very specific in dealing with suppliers. Never assume they understand what you mean. You have to remember that their culture is different, and you are dealing with a language barrier, that sometimes make things hard to effectively communicate.

The last thing you want is to have all demand, but no supply, it's a great way to lose customers.\n\nTo add to the first point, if you insist on doing something complicated like electronics, use a third party inspection company. These companies come in, and inspect all of your product for any flaws, before it leaves the manufacturing plant.

Generally, you have to pay them per man hour, and have to pay for their travel to your suppliers manufacturing facility, and hotel.

Ordinary electrical products can also be a worry, but if they have genuine certification certificates that will usually mean they will be relatively trouble free. It is important to know that certificates of any kind can be forged and often are. Unless they are certified online by a reliable inspection service you should check them yourself.  To do this you email the certifying authority a copy, telling them you have doubts regarding the authenticity and asking them to confirm if it is genuine. Clothing is a troublesome product area also. mainly because so much of it is labor intensive. and the labor is not consistent. My approach would be to emphasize your expectation of quality in your first contact and mention it again whenever appropriate. That will often sort out those who find QC too hard and they will stop communicating with you before you order.\nI suspect you may have been dealing with a trader who has obtained an end of line run. That is often the case if you buy through Aliexpress which is a B2C site and not B2B, but it does happen on other sites. Never believe that someone is a manufacturer without doing due diligence.\nWalter", "maleek said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nBefore I respond, I just want to say I'm not trying to steal the AMA, just simply trying to help:\n\n1)Here's a general guideline that I follow for people just starting out: Electronics.

I like your analogy about specifying that a car must have an engine. One area of misunderstanding is in the English alphabet. Check and double check anything that requires lettering or numbers incorporated. To a Chinese person with limited or no English, a C can look like a G. There are also many words in the English language that have multiple meanings and it pays to avoid them when specifying. Defense items are more or less of a problem depending on which country you are importing into, but usually in the US the \"normal\" ones like a Swiss army knife will not alarm Customs inspectors.\nI recommend that if you want to use a third party inspection service you use one of the big European companies such as Intertek Group PLC, a a UK based organization with impeccable credentials, established 130 years. or SGS, a Swiss organization about as old. Sinotrust in China is a reliable service as is the us based KRT Audit Corporation. The cost will vary, but for a small shipment that happens to be located in a city where the inspectors are also located, expect to pay $250 to $300. It can be much more, so get a written quote. I don't recommend sourcing agents because they are just as likely to be working for themselves as for you.\nWalter", "maleek said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nThis is kind of an afterthought, but still relevant:\n\nSomething that saved me extreme heartache was that I found a customs broker that was familiar with Chinese customs, and spoke the language!

A Customs broker who speaks Chinese will be harder to find than a Freight forwarder with a Chinese speaker on the staff. If you are shipping goods by sea which requires a B/L I would always recommend using a freight forwarder to organize everything.\n\nWalter", "Traveling to source supplies. Do you need to visit China? \n\nIn this post I am concentrating on trade fairs, but later I will post on the subject of traveling to China in order to visit manufacturers at their factories. It will include the proper protocol when visiting a Chinese business.\n\nFor those who can afford the time and money to take a trip to China I would highly recommend it. Nothing can beat face to face contact with potential suppliers.\n\nThere are a few things potential importers need to know before going to trade fairs in China.\n1. Trade fairs can be mind boggling. The vast product range will fill your head with ideas, so you need to make sure you take detailed notes, as well as collecting catalogs.\n2. Be prepared to spend two or three days at a fair. They are massive.\n3. Always contact exhibitors well before you travel. Deal with them via email as though you were not going to China. You should have narrowed down the field before you go. Do let them know you are coming to the fair.\n4. DON'T commit yourself on the day, unless you have had plenty of prior contact with the supplier. Your mind will be in a whirl and after committing yourself you may find a product or supplier a few stalls away that will be much better for your business.\n5. Don't accept any statement that the supplier you are talking to is really a manufacturer. Just as you will find happens on B2B sourcing portals, many trade fair exhibitors claim to be manufacturers but are not.\n6. Allow time to visit other suppliers that you may have previously contacted, who are not exhibiting. China is a big country so plan your trip and in particular all the internal travel carefully.\n7. Make your travel and accommodation bookings early. Check with the fair organizers to see if they have special deals with any hotels. When you leave your hotel take the hotel\u2019s business card with you to help taxi drivers understand where you want to go at the end of the day.\n8. Remember that Chinese business people have a different concept of the word \"Yes\". To them it can mean maybe, perhaps, possibly, probably, no, or even yes. They are not being dishonest, they are just trying to please, and to them, saying no is impolite.\n9. I would not bother going to the biggest fair in China. It is known as Yiwu market, and it is mind boggling. The market covers 1,000 acres and has 70,000 stalls. Many, and in my experience most, of the stall holders do not speak English, so you would need a translator. Having been required to use a translator in my exporting days when I was selling product to China, I can tell you that it puts you under a serious disadvantage.\n10. This may seem out of place but it is worth considering visiting trade fairs in your own country. Depending on the industry sector featured, there will often be many overseas exhibitors.\n11. To find trade fairs, check out http://www.tssn.com\n\nWalter", "The difference between Alibaba and Aliexpress.\n\nIn my initial post I said I would deal with misinformation.\n\nFrom what I read on forums including this forum it is clear that many people think that the main differences between Alibaba and Aliexpress are the MOQs quoted, free postage on Aliexpress, and slightly higher prices there than on Alibaba.\n\nThere are other differences worth noting.\n\n1.

Because I emphasize the importance of paying via escrow I would like to alter members to a big risk.

Your claim will be submitted to our Dispute Resolution Team.\n If dispute requests are not approved within 30 days of submission, the Order will automatically be directed to our Dispute Resolution Team.\n\nBuyers and suppliers should keep any evidence of shipments, deliveries or transactions that are relevant to their dispute and submit this material as evidence to Alibaba.com before claim begins: \n1. When make a File Claim, you should also submit evidence at the same time \n2. Requests for dispute will be cancelled if evidence is not provided within 7 days of application \n3. Alibaba.com will contact both parties when mediation is approved and will judge each case according to evidence provided by both parties \n4. If the supplier wants to appeal against the buyer's claim, they also need to provide evidence \n5. All decisions made by Alibaba.com are final\"\n\n\"You can submit an Open Dispute any time before you confirm delivery of your order. Open Dispute can be made if: \n\u00b7Goods are not received 27 days after the supplier has confirmed shipment\n\u00b7Goods are not received in satisfactory condition\"\n\n\"Dispute Requests may or may not be approved by suppliers. Please negotiate with the supplier to reach an agreement. Most disputes are made because of miscommunication between buyers and suppliers. We advise you communicate with the supplier to resolve your problems.\n\n\nIf the supplier agrees to the refund request, money will be refunded to you and the transaction closed. If the supplier rejects your refund request, you can always modify the request based on mutually agreed terms.\n\n\nHowever, if an agreement still can't be reached within 30 days of the initial Open Dispute, the dispute will automatically be submitted to Alibaba.com for mediation.\"\n\nAs above, they state that you can file a claim any time before you confirm receipt of the goods. The period allowed for negotiation before a claim lapses appears to be 30 days.\n\nI have been informed by many unhappy people that vendors have begun negotiations with every appearance that they will either replace the goods free of charge, refund the payment, or give a big discount, but after some time the tone changes and they eventually either refuse any request or they just stop communicating. When the buyer then tries to escalate the dispute they find that the time has elapsed and payment has been released to the vendor.", "Dicky Dee said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nGreat info you have given us here, this post is especially helpful as it allowed me to find out the supplier im working with is a trading company after all, although i dont mind because their communication with me through email is very fast and english is pretty good as well.

As I read it, they have given you a two part answer, both parts meaning the same thing. They will grant you an exclusive agency for their brand. I should add that it is rare to be granted an exclusive agency by a Chinese company unless you are willing to place a very substantial order, quite likely well in excess of their usual MOQ.\n\nIn addition, you need to be aware that when granted, it is common for exclusive agencies to be used for market testing, and if successful, the manufacturer will then open their own sales office and you lose the business.\n\n3. Yes, almost every manufacturer will allow this. The trendy idea of private labeling is nothing new. \n\n4. Do your own product testing. Don't rely on the manufacturer, and certainly in these days of Photoshop, it is possible to make Dracula look like Prince Charming, so photos can be deceiving.\n\n5. I assume the price you have been quoted is FOB. In that case I would want a much better price than $13. When you take into account freight, duty, Sales Tax, Amazon or eBay fees, PayPal fees and postage you will not have much left if you sell at $35. When I was running my importing business I taught my franchisees not to bother with a product unless at a minimum they could sell at total landed cost X 250%. Sales were all B2B, so Amazon and eBay did not figure. The margins were often higher. To obtain a landed cost you will need to get a quote on freight, and for that you need first to ask the supplier for package sizes and weight per package. Then you can obtain quotes for freight, but you will always be asked dimensions as well as weight.\n\n6. First I would look for other manufacturers of comparable products and get quotes. Assuming you get a better price I would then blank out all identifying information and email a scanned copy to your preferred supplier and ask if he can match the price. Say you have been impressed by their service attitude and would prefer to deal with them. \n\n7. You do not need an import/export license. Whoever clears your first shipment for you will obtain a number that will henceforth identify all your shipments as belonging to you.\n\nTOPIC HEADINGS PREVIOUSLY POSTED IN THIS THREAD:\nIntroduction.

With the advantage of a patent to enhance saleability for you, if not a higher price at your end, you may be happy to work on what I would regard as a low margin.\n\nWithout knowing package dimensions, weight etc, it is impossible for me to anything but guess. If I guess freight at $3, I would have to buy at $4 to provide the margin that I always expected. Believe me, that is not necessarily an impossibility, but I would not haggle with the seller. I know that most \"experts\" recommend it, but haggling will damage the seller's respect for you. The best margin I ever achieved was landed cost X 700%, but one of my franchisees did slightly better. He wrote to me once and said \"...It's nice to make that occasional $50,000 for half a day's work.\" His landed cost was $7,000, and he sold at $57,000 so his mark up was landed cost X 814%.\n\nI taught my franchisees to sell at what the market would bear whenever possible.\n\nLet me know when you have a freight quote.\n\nWalter", "I'm in the process of sourcing tin cans for the packaging of my product.

Let me know and I will advise further.\n\nIf you intend shipping empty cans, you need to consider freight cost before you spend money on samples. For empty cans you will pay freight on a cubic ton basis and that can be very expensive.\n\nWalter", "Hi walter, \nI need only the empty cans. \nthanks", "Cruiser said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nHi walter,\nI need only the empty cans.\nthanksClick to expand...\n\nOK, The first thing you must do is to ask the supplier to tell you package dimensions, number of cans per package, weight per package, and the total number of packages. \n\nAlso ask which port will they ship from. In other words FOB port.\n\nThen contact a local freight forwarder in your country, give them all those details and tell them what the goods are. Ask them for a quote for the shipment from that port delivered to your door. Specify that the quote must include all charges including clearance through Customs. Remember you will still have to pay duty and sales tax if sales tax applies. Get the quote in writing.\n\nThen you take the total cost of the product ex China, add the freight, multiply the total by whatever duty rate the freight forwarder has told you and you will have your landed cost. Add sales tax if it applies in your case. You then divide the total by the number of cans and you will know whether or not it will pay you to import them. I have my doubts unless it is a very large quantity sufficient to fill a 20' container.\n\nThe % of faulty or damaged goods in a shipment will depend on the nature of the product and the quality of the packaging. Cans are semi-fragile, so I would expect as high as 10% unless they are in wooden crates.

In that case, insurance is essential and the insurance company will cover you for any damage. I suggest you pay by L/C and for the supplier to get payment they will have to provide a Clean On Board Bill of Lading. The shipping company will not provide a Clean On Board B/L if they consider the packaging to be inadequate.\n\nI am assuming design refers to the printing and not to the shape of the can.\n\nThere are various methods available for printing cans, but Chinese can manufacturers will rarely use any printing method other than Lithography,  and that involves considerable set up cost and big runs to make it viable. It may pay you to consider buying your cans in the USA, where the smaller run option of Digital Printing is available. One such can manufacturer that I know on the East Coast is http://www.ballsteeltinusa.com \n\nIf your volume is sufficient to warrant using lithography China may be your better option, but freight cost may make the difference. Ease of communication and other factors may justify paying more.\n\nIn any case, you will need to send your artwork, and specify Pantone colors. Pantone color charts are available online or from printing supplies businesses. Even some printers sell them.\n\nYour supplier will modify the artwork to suit their system and email a copy. Bear in mind that different computers present colors differently. For real life colors you must see a sample printed on the actual medium (steel) being used. I don't think you need a printed sample can, just a printed sample on sheet metal.\n\nIf digital print is used, a sample will be low cost and quick. The production run price will invariably be higher than lithographic print, but smaller order requirements may compensate for that.\n\nIf you are not happy with a printed sample, it will be costly to start over with a new lithographic plate. If the supplier has not quoted separately for the set up, it would be advisable to ask so that you know what cost you might incur if the original is unsatisfactory. In case you choose to cancel your order, you should have previously obtained written confirmation that your refund would be your 30% deposit minus that set up charge.\n\nP.S. I often advise my students to consider the USA as a manufacturing source. It is largely overlooked, but many US manufacturers are quite competitive. The same applies to a number of developed countries, including Italy and Germany, but in your case, proximity to the US is advantageous.\n\nTOPIC HEADINGS PREVIOUSLY POSTED IN THIS THREAD:\nIntroduction.

But I agree that you should minimize risk as much as possible. In relation to that, I believe that knowledge is power. Sadly I see too many people jumping in the deep end just relying on snippets of information they have picked up on forums.\n\nTo avoid seeming like a novice, you need to:\n\nIdentify yourself as an established importer.\nGive yourself a title such as purchasing manager.\nDon't ask what is the MOQ.\nDon't ask immediately for a sample. Instead, request a catalog, whether online or printed -- preferably the latter. It can tell you a lot that is hard to find online.\nDon't promise to place large orders.\nIf completing an online sales inquiry form, leave out the expected order quantity. If it is required field, insert 000000.\nWU is very risky because scammers rarely accept payment by any other method. In brief, the technique they use is to ask for payment to an individual. They collect cash and run. In exceptional cases, where you have built a relationship with a supplier WU can be used safely. \n\nWalter", "topherea said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nThank you very much for that info!

I find that's a relatively easy way to find out if they're the real deal or not\" I would add that if they say No, then you know they are not manufacturers, but if they say Yes, that does not prove that they are. In fact even if you visit, you cannot be sure that they actually own the factory you are visiting.

Your edit states a higher total profit when selling for less.\n\nRegardless of that, my concern is whether the profit is net after selling costs such as eBay, Amazon, PayPal, and postage. If it is a net figure, then doubling your money is probably OK, although I would not settle for that personally.\n\nIf you want to proceed, I would now try to negotiate a sample order of maybe 100 in order to reduce your risk.

If you intend visiting factories, there is no point in the exercise unless you are very confident that the supplier is one you want to do business with.\n\nIt is important to remember that China is a huge country and travel within Chinese cities can be appallingly slow. It is acceptable to let the potential suppliers know when you will be in the country and that you will contact them on arrival in the city where you will be staying. Having arranged to visit them, check all travel arrangements necessary to be there on time. The hotel staff will usually help you with this.\n\nI will introduce this subject with a story about finding a supplier\u2019s factory in Taipei. When I first started visiting China as an importer, I already knew my way around Taipei in Taiwan because I had for some years been exporting to Taiwan as well as mainland China where my biggest customer was.\n\nAs an exporter I had been introduced to many businessmen, mostly \u201ccousins\u201d and from those introductions I eventually set up as an importer in 1987. The problem was that most of the cousins could not satisfy my product requirements so I had to look elsewhere.\n\nI knew how to make contact with potential suppliers, and I made a point of visiting them as part of my due diligence. One of the reasons was that I wanted to deal only with manufacturers, so I needed to visit their premises. This is where the fun began.\n\nUnlike India or Pakistan, the addresses of people and businesses in China (and Taiwan) are set out in a very orderly fashion. On one visit I had to find two potential suppliers whose addresses did not sound auspicious. They went something like this: No. 75, Alley 16, Lane 23, Nanking East Road. An alley off a lane!\n\nThe two could not have been more different. Chalk and Cheese! The first I found after a hair-raising taxi ride which stopped in the lane, unable to reach the alley, because of heaps of cartons, bicycles, motor scooters etc., clogging access. Eventually on foot I found the alley, then the premises. \n\nIn the usual fashion I was treated to tiny cups of Jasmine scented green tea, but there was so little room that even the sofa where guests should be received had to be cleared for sufficient space to sit down. The staff of 3 were continually interrupted by the telephone, and it did not take me long to decide that this was simply a wholesaler, or reseller, or agent, who knew little about the product type I sought although they had advertised it.\n\nThe second one was not very far away so I walked and was amazed to find in their alley a gleaming showroom, with well set up offices, and the light manufacturing process being carried out in immaculate premises upstairs. I dealt with that manufacturer for about 4 years until my business began to leave that product line.\n\nOnce you arrive at the business premises, you will usually be greeted on arrival by someone who may appear to be a junior staff member, but it is customary for a female staff member to be appointed as your hostess. She will speak good English and her mission is to make you feel like an honored guest while observing strict propriety.\n\nShe will often have some authority to negotiate, but price negotiations on the first contact are not desirable. Do that later in your visit, or even later on your return home. Visits are usually restricted to the reception area, where you usually drink Jasmine flavored green tea. If you empty your cup, it will be refilled.\n\nBefore leaving home you should have asked to visit the factory. If the factory is on the same premises as the office you are in, you may be sure you are dealing with a manufacturer. If taken to another location, do the following to determine whether or not the people you are dealing with own the factory: Assuming you cannot read Chinese, just compare Chinese characters on signs outside the premises with those on the business card supplied by your hosts.\n\nBear in mind that factories are often multi-story, with a multitude of businesses in the same building, so there may not be a noticeable sign. In that case ask the factory manager for his card. If this causes embarrassment or he cannot supply one, it strongly suggests that you are dealing with an agent, not directly with the manufacturer. If you request a card, you should also offer yours. Ask your hostess, \u201cDo you own this factory?\u201d You will only know the answer is truthful if she says no. If she says yes, you cannot be sure. This is not necessarily due to dishonesty, as she may misunderstand your question, or she may interpret it to mean, \u201cIs this the factory that produces all of your products?\u201d The investigations done prior to your trip will also help in your assessment.\n\nOne thing that you will find is that determining whether or not the supplier is a genuine manufacturer is not easy. I now find it easier to determine that by using the reports published by independent European inspection services and found on a few B2B sourcing sites, and I would limit my visits to those suppliers that have been verified in that manner.\n\nDon't forget, if you want to find your way back to your hotel, make sure you have the hotel\u2019s card to show to the taxi driver.\n\nWalter", "Fantastic info in this thread.\n\nI have a question about your product selection process.\n\nDo you look for products and then investigate potential demand?\n\nOr do you find a need in the market and then see if a product can be sourced?\n\nOr is there another way?\n\nCheers", "Simon Ashari said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nFantastic info in this thread.\n\nI have a question about your product selection process.\n\nDo you look for products and then investigate potential demand?\n\nOr do you find a need in the market and then see if a product can be sourced?\n\nOr is there another way?\n\nCheersClick to expand...\n\nI am no longer selling any physical products. I retired a few years ago, and I have never done any serious online marketing.\n\nWith that disclaimer behind me, let me just say that the two highly successful businesses I started from zero both involved products that were in high demand. I knew about the first one because I had been a successful salesman in that industry.\n\nMy first real business: I knew there were major product improvements possible, but my boss would never allow me to make any changes. A year after I left that job and could not find any suitable sales position I said \"Heck, I know where there is a market for a product that has not yet been developed!\" It was an industrial chemical product and I played around with formulas until I found the right one, and I launched it on the market. Within 3 years I had a national monopoly in that specialized area, and within 11 years I was exporting the product to Asia Pacific countries. Price was not an issue. I could ask whatever I wanted because the product eclipsed the competition from some of the biggest chemical companies in the world. They were stuck in a rut. I thought outside the square.\n\nMy second real business: A passing complaint by a family member about the atrocious service his business was getting from every supplier they had tried for a particular product, triggered an idea. During my many visits to China as an exporter I had been urged by numerous contacts to consider importing what they manufactured. One such product was the exact type that my family member had mentioned. I started by buying locally to test the market, but quickly tired of the poor service and indifferent quality, so I began buying from China. Wow! Better service, faster delivery, and substantially superior quality all at incredibly low cost. That low cost did not stop me from selling at prices way higher than my local competition, because I was also selling something they could not get: service.\n\nSo to answer your question more directly, I found a need in the market and then in Business #1 developed the product and made it myself and in Business #2 I accidentally found a need in the market and I sourced the product overseas. By the way I did not buy from the business that offered me their product while I was in China.\n\nWalter", "Walter Hay said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nMy first real business: I knew there were major product improvements possible, but my boss would never allow me to make any changes.

I am not a qualified chemist, and that is why I said 'playing around with formulas'. I had a good idea from practical experience that certain chemicals would enhance the performance of the products that almost every factory in those industries used, and so I experimented with many, many variations until I found one that worked very well. I had to test it in production and the production manager at one of the factories where I used to sell the inferior product was happy to try it. After a short production run he placed a big order on the spot. The experimenting took me a long time and required a huge amount of patience and persistence. I manufactured the product myself to maintain secrecy.\n\nIf you can find a market for industrial chemicals, you can do very well importing from China, but most chemical companies there will expect commodity size orders. You would need to look for \"Specialty Chemicals\" in order to find smaller companies that will be happy to deal with you.\n\nYou can source almost any product imaginable from China. but I would avoid Electronics, Food, and Food Supplements.", "GregH said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nIs this just for certain types of products or all products?Click to expand...\n\nIt is not all products, but there can be many surprises. If labor is not a huge factor, the product may be competitive with China in many other countries.\n\nJust look at retail stores and see what types of manufactured products made in Germany, Italy, USA, Australia etc, are retailing at prices equal to or even lower than similar products from China.\n\nI recently purchased batteries for small electrical devices and they were made in Germany. Quality is great and the prices matched those from China.\n\nThe lowest prices I ever saw for souvenir decals were from a manufacturer in Italy.\n\nI have seen stunning original design jewelry in the Czech Republic that you would never see in most western countries and the prices were amazingly low. \n\nLow wages are not the only factor. I know of one labor intensive factory in Boston MA, where the business is booming and believe it or not, the average age of the workers is over 70! They are paid regular wages, but the company says they provide better productivity than younger workers, and as a result this long established business remains competitive and sales continue to grow.\n\nThe moral of the story is - think outside the square.\n\nTOPIC HEADINGS PREVIOUSLY POSTED IN THIS THREAD:\nIntroduction.

One of those big sites, Alibaba does have an audit system that sometimes includes social responsibility compliance verification, but it only applies to suppliers displaying a red tick in a blue circle and it is essential to read the whole audit report. Two of the sites that I recommend instead of the big sites routinely have supplier assessment processes that include not only verification of their manufacturing capability, but also verification of social compliance.\n\nThis means that they satisfy the strictest rules regarding employees' ages and working conditions, as well as social responsibilities.\n\nDuring my many visits to China since I started exporting there in 1978, I have seen great improvements in working conditions. I have visited numerous factories and examined their manufacturing processes.\n\nWhen I began importing in 1987, conditions in the factories operated by most of my suppliers were on a par with conditions I had observed in other countries such as USA, Australia, and the UK. A few had some way to go to catch up.\n\nNow, when I visit those socially responsible manufacturers they have premises that look more like pharmaceutical factories than industrial premises. The industrial processes that generate dust no longer show signs of that dust on the floors. Cleanliness is almost clinical. Workers have plenty of room. Floors have line markings to separate production areas from forklift and trolley traffic areas so risk of injury is very small.\n\nSome of these improvements are a direct result of Government regulations, but others are a result of a pragmatic decision to satisfy western buyers. In either case the outcome is good for the workers.\n\nWhile it is a sad fact that China ranks as the 84th worst country for slavery I know that my importing students can be confident that they are dealing with manufacturers whose practices are as fair as those in any western countries.

This situation highlights the value of building those relationships and that can involve simple things such as friendly exchange of greetings at appropriate times without any reference to business matters.\n\nIn addition to holiday greetings, an example could be to thank your contact for the prompt and helpful manner in which they have been dealing with your emails.

It can pay to treat your suppliers the same way you would treat your customers in order to maintain their custom.\n\nI agree with your approach regarding possibly splitting cost of freight on the replacement packaging.

Those who rely on me for guidance would not appreciate it if I broadcast their niche or their perfect supplier's name.\n\nI will post a new question and answer periodically.\n\nQ: I have seen some great products that look almost identical to one of the well known brands, but they are unbranded. Can I buy these and put my own label on?\n\nA: Never ever try to import branded goods either for personal use or especially for resale.\n\nOne thing often overlooked is that unbranded copies of big brand goods can also land you in big trouble. Designs are copyrighted, so if it looks even almost identical to the real thing it is illegal to buy or sell it. The differences in appearance might make you think that it does not infringe copyright, but is it worth the risk of losing all your money, a lawsuit, and possible fines?\n\nA second point overlooked is that rebuilt, renovated, repaired, or refurbished genuine branded goods can also land you in deep water. One of the reasons is that in virtually every case, the parts used for the refurbishment will be non-genuine, but the main reason is that Customs in every country have automatic alerts that flag anything with those brands, so even a single refurbished item is likely to come to their attention.\n\nYou will never win an argument with them about the goods being second hand, and do you want the hassle and likely loss of your money anyway?

Contracts (and a warranty is a contract) are extremely difficult to enforce in China.\n\nEven if a business in China were to agree to a contract with a clause making it enforceable in a court of law in your local jurisdiction, there is no way you could force an unwilling party to abide by such a clause.\n\nYour best warranty is a good relationship. Chinese people put a lot of value on their word and if you have established a good relationship so that they will also be satisfied that they can rely on your word, you will find that warranty issues will be handled without any problem.\n\nIt is worth telling any prospective supplier at the beginning of your communication with them that quality is important to you. This will not necessarily result in you paying more, although sometimes it will, but it will often weed out those suppliers who do not stand by their products. \n\nThere are many factories that manufacture to two different quality standards. I have been in factories where one production line puts out trash quality to satisfy the extremely low cost demanded by some customers, (often big retailers,) and high quality for those who want repeat customers. It would surprise most people to know how small the price difference can be, but if a big retailer is buying a million items that they are paying maybe $2 for, 10c = $100,000. \n\nDuring the time I ran my importing business I developed those good relationships that I recommend building, and before long, warranty issues were resolved by my word about a problem, sometimes backed up with photographs. Rarely did I or my franchisees have to return any items to China.\n\nUntil you have built that relationship, and indeed as part of that building process, you wear the problem, but you do mention it politely. If you don't adopt a demanding attitude a supplier may well volunteer some compensation, usually by way of a small discount on the next order. If they can see that you are not trying to take advantage of them, they will chalk that up as a point in your favor. \n\nIt is easier for you to accept some losses due to warranty issues if you buy at the right price, but that is another story.\n\nFinally, don't forget that trust works two ways.\n\nWalter", "Walter Hay said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nUnfortunately...Click to expand...\n\nPerfect answer, thank you very much.", "Alibaba and the 2236 thieves.\nThere is so much about Alibaba that has been published but is not known to most people unless they read financial news, so I thought I would add a link to a news item from the Economist headed: Alibaba and the 2236 thieves. See the link below.\n\nI know that this news item is now a few years old, but the Gold Supplier system is unchanged, so I believe the report still has value to those who have not seen it before.\n\nFor those who don't want to read the whole article, here is a small extract:\n\n\"Alibaba, China's leading e-commerce platform, faces the same challenge, but more so. It operates in a country where fraud is rife. And it has grown at a dizzying pace: 56m people use its business-to-business website, it claims, and 370m use Taobao, its online mall. This week it ran into trouble. On February 21st, in a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Alibaba admitted that it had granted \u201cgold\u201d status (a mark of supposed integrity) to 2,236 dealers who it says subsequently defrauded buyers.\"\n\nTwo of Alibaba's senior executives at the time resigned in the usual Asian way of \"accepting responsibility\u201d which is in effect an attempt at taking the heat off the company.\n\nIn my opinion the situation was made worse when Alibaba discounted their Gold Supplier fee from $2990 to $299 for most of last year. This resulted in a flood of new Gold Suppliers on the site, but readers should realize that Gold Supplier status has always been bought, not earned.\n\nIt is worth noting the Economist's comment about Gold Supplier status: \"(a mark of supposed integrity)\" In emails that I have received from Alibaba they state that one of the reasons for becoming registered as a Gold Supplier is:\n\n\u201c6. Buyers trust you because your company is verified by the credit agency.\u201d That credit agency verification is performed as part of the \u201cOnsite Check\u201d which happens to be identical to the onsite check for ordinary Verified Suppliers and is almost identical to the A&V check. Here is a cut and paste from Alibaba\u2019s site regarding that process: \n\n\u201cOnsite Check is a verification process for China Gold Suppliers. The supplier\u2019s company\u2019s premises are checked by Alibaba.com\u2019s staff to ensure onsite operations exist there. The suppliers\u2019 legal status and other related information are then confirmed by a third-party verification agency.\u201d What this all amounts to is that regardless of the badges displayed the only thing you can be sure of is that the business actually exists and at least has an office that they may have rented for the day. Does that reassure you?\n\nThere is an exception and it is the Supplier Assessment which is identified by a red tick in a blue circle. The report is lengthy and should be read in its entirety if you want to know if the supplier really is a manufacturer.\n\nHere is the link to the news item: http://www.economist.com/node/18233750\n\nPlease don't think I am just knocking Alibaba.

Its gonna help save us time, and a whole lot of $$ in the long run.Click to expand...\n\nI have numbered the points you raise so that it is easier to follow my answers.\n\n1. No. The fact that they are listed as manufacturers means nothing. Almost all suppliers on Alibaba are listed as manufacturers, but in the majority of cases that is false.\n\n2. Some manufacturers are also trading companies, and that applies in particular to state owned businesses, but as a general rule if they have the word trading in their name, or if they identify themselves as traders, I would not bother with them.\n\n3. That is true. Genuine manufacturers tend to specialize. That is part of the Chinese culture, where certain cites are almost entirely devoted to manufacturing one type of product.\n\n4. Traders and wholesalers tend to require large MOQs and they are usually inflexible about reducing the number. One reason is that they want to make a killing on the first order because people often find that they can buy cheaper elsewhere. Another reason is that they often do not have a formal agreement with the actual manufacturer. They use images from the manufacturer's website or catalog, make a sale, take a deposit, and then hope to get the manufacturer to supply them at a price that will give them a profit. The bigger the order, the better chance they have of getting the manufacturer to supply them. If they won't, they will usually refund your deposit but that often takes a long time.\n\n5.  1) Yes, but you must read the report, because not all who have supplier assessments are manufacturers and that will be stated in the report. The reports can be 10 - 15 pages, but if they are manufacturers their capacity will be stated, so it is worth reading.\n     2) Gold status is worth almost nothing in relation to their capability, reliability, or trustworthiness.\n\n6. I recommend a small number of safe sites, including HKTDC, which is a relatively small site, but you also need to follow safe sourcing practice. It takes me 83 pages to teach that. That is why I don't just publish my recommended sites. \n\n\n\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\nWalter", "thanks for the info.

They would not dare publish a fake number online but in an email to you they would not care.\n\n.hk domains come under a much more liberal jurisdiction and no such number is required. The more liberal rules and regulations in HK are a major reason why huge numbers of Chinese businesses have an office in HK. They will usually transact all their business there.", "Sourcing From Countries Other Than China. Is it Worth It?\n\nRising living standards in China are making Chinese products less competitive.\n\nI have a friend who imports vinyl products and has built a big business out of it, although he now finds local manufacturers are giving him some stiff competition. This is one reason I recommend that would-be importers consider countries other than China. Government labor regulations there are increasing costs and as a result many Chinese companies are moving offshore!\n\nDoes that sound familiar? It is part of the cycle of chasing low labor costs. Japan was once the cheap source, then Korea, then Taiwan, then mainland China, and now Chinese companies are setting up in lower cost Asian and African countries.\n\nI am a retired importer but I still maintain my contacts. One of my long time contacts in China reports that his factories are now compelled to provide ever increasing perks to his 6,000 employees as well as higher wages and shorter hours. He says his labor costs have risen 40% in the past 3 years and he is planning on expanding offshore, although he won\u2019t close his factories in China.\n\nAs evidence of this changing scene, a number of US companies are now returning their manufacturing to the US.\n\nSo where does this leave people looking for cheap products to resell? Well there are still plenty of them available in China.\n\nThose looking to source products there should be aware that many factories turn out two quality standards of the same product. One is made to meet a price demand and the other is made to meet a quality demand. The interesting thing is that the price difference is often very small.\n\nI have directed many people to other countries where they have been able to obtain better quality at the same price as in China, or sometimes they have bought similar quality but at a lower price. In some cases they have found unique products not produced in China.\n\nSourcing from China is easy, although many people get burnt for that very reason. They think it is so easy that they can be careless about sourcing. They treat it as casually as buying from their local store and they blindly accept everything they read on B2B sourcing sites.\n\nSourcing from other countries will require greater expertise, but I have taught many people how to do it. Those who do begin sourcing in other countries may well be one step ahead of the competition in a few years\u2019 time.\n\nTOPIC HEADINGS PREVIOUSLY POSTED IN THIS THREAD:\n\u25a0 Introduction.

It is critically important to first do your homework on product selection. I am not an expert in that area but there are others on the forum that can help in that regard.\n\nIf you have selected a product that you are very confident will sell, and you know the price that it will most likely sell at, as well as your selling costs such as postage to your customer, eBay, Amazon, and PayPal fees, that will tell you the maximum landed price you can afford to spend on buying the product.\n\nTo work out the landed cost you should first get the total of the unit price + freight. Then add the duty calculated on that total. Remember that in most countries there will be duty exemptions for shipments below a certain value. It varies from country to country. After adding duty, then add Sales Tax. This final total is your landed cost.\n\nIf the final figure is at or below what you have worked out as the maximum landed cost, you can then proceed to check out a sample or multiple samples. If you have thoroughly researched the manufacturer, you might choose to import a small quantity as a sample shipment in order to reduce the freight cost per unit.

Escrow? Using WU or T/T is just asking to get scammed, isn't it?Click to expand...\n\nUnfortunately few suppliers will accept Escrow, except many on Alibaba , but a lot of others there won't. The safest method and virtually foolproof is payment by Letter of Credit. (L/C)\n\nThis is almost identical to escrow, but is done through the major banks. Cost may be more than T/T but it is completely secure as long as you have been scrupulously careful in setting out the specifications and all order details. It is usually only economically viable for larger orders, but if you want maximum safety, that is the way to go. I can give more details on L/C if you like, (it may help other fastlaners) but I think you will find all you need to know when you read the relevant section in the book.\n\nPayment by WU is an almost total no-no, with the exception being when you have established a good relationship with the supplier and have had a number of satisfactory transactions. There is still a very small risk because the cash can be collected almost anonymously.\n\nPayment by T/T is very common and has a small degree of safety in that you will only pay to the supplier's business bank account. If you have done your due diligence, including following my advice about correlating post and telephone codes you should be satisfied that the vendor is genuine. Some of the B2B sourcing site reporting systems that I refer to in my book can give you a great deal of confidence and if you have read those reports on your chosen supplier I expect that you would not be worried about paying by T/T.", "Q & A 3.\n\nThis Q & A is very fresh, being from the thread \u201cCaught in Alibaba Hell\u201d but I include it because it shows the consequences of limiting your search to the one B2B site, and I think more people will benefit from my answer if I put it in my thread. I hope there is no rule against this.\n\nQ. I have spent countless hours on Alibaba, searching, posting buying requests and responding to quotes. I think am being very clear in what I am sourcing and even including pictures and I still get replys for things which don't meet my needs or questions, that were already answered in the request. And then when I do find something I think will work, the cost for a sample is 2000% higher than the actual item. i.e a ball that cost 0.30, is 60.00 for a sample. Aliexpress hasn't proven much better.\n\nI am sourcing SOLID (hollow is everywhere) rubber balls with a 1/2 hole in the middle, the size of a tennis ball, but smaller or larger will be needed in the future.\n\nRight now, I am really not trying to purchase 500+ balls\n\nA. I got a notice about a reply on this thread, so I came back to look. When I saw that you did not appear to have made much progress, I decided to do a quick search of one of my favorite B2B sourcing sites.\n\nWithin 3 minutes I found hard rubber balls, complete with hole, various sizes, can be made to your specs, with no mold charge, any Pantone color, MOQ 100 pcs. Unlike most manufacturers they will accept payment via PayPal.\n\nPrices quoted are way below many of the prices you will find on Alibaba, and half the best price. Also on Alibaba the MOQ is 1,000 - 5,000. I suggest it would pay you to buy 100 @ 15c each, because the freight on them will be not a lot more than you have been quoted for a single sample.\n\nIf you like to start a conversation with me I will give you a link to the factory's website.

It would be rare for a supplier in China to do anything to provide any kind of support for new client initial promotion, except perhaps a small discount, and even that would be very rare. Using \"their brand\" does not necessarily indicate that they are the manufacturers. Also if it is their brand, the silk screens would already exist, and although moderately labor intensive a multi-color screen printing process should not cost you a dollar per item.\n\nI think they are just trying to justify a high MOQ and such an approach would usually indicate that you are dealing with a wholesaler. \n\nThere are many ways of applying your own label/logo etc., and I have had a lot of experience in that field, so if you are willing to confidentially tell me the nature of the product, I may be able to suggest a more cost effective method.", "Hey Walter, \n\nApplying my own label is a good idea, however it wouldn't be possible. Their brand name is etched directly on the product, the only way to remove it is to order 3000 units. I want to make sure this is not a wholesaler as I don't want unnecessary labels and markups.

If the item is metal, it can be laser engraved, or photo etched. In either case it would not be very costly to set up. I am guessing that it is probably not colored, in which case laser engraving of 100 items could be done quite economically in the US, or most western countries. Photo etching can also be done locally but the set up cost is substantially higher.\n\nI suggest your best way to order a small quantity is to tell them you want to buy 100 pcs unbranded as a trial order. You can then have them engraved locally to test the market. If they won't agree to that, you are definitely dealing with a wholesaler.", "Hey Walter,\n\nAwesome thread!

When I ran my own manufacturing business, the one where I exported to Asia Pacific countries including China, I developed what was almost a monopoly by introducing superior products of my own formulation. In one industry I did have a monopoly until I refused an offer from an overseas company.

A number of them rang me to ask If I would like them to obtain samples for me to check out.\n\nAs it happens I lost 1 customer, who returned cap in hand 3 months later asking for my help to remedy the production disaster that had cost them 10 times what they were paying me annually for my expensive product.\n\nEven when importing, I quickly gained a 90% market share in the major part of the market, despite having higher prices. But I had superior quality (sourced from China and Malaysia) and I gave service such as they never dreamed of.\n\nBoth businesses were B2B and it is easier to gain market dominance selling B2B.

Traveling to Source Supplies.  Do you need to Visit China? Manufacturers. \n\nIn Part 1 I dealt with visiting trade fairs. Now I will concentrate on visits to manufacturers, specifically to inspect their factories.\n\nIf you plan to visit China in your search for suppliers, you should first research online and narrow down the possible list of suppliers to a manageable number depending on their location and the amount of time you will be in the country. Communicate with them frequently to help you assess their attitude to service, QC, etc. Let them know that you plan to visit, and would like to see their factory. If they won\u2019t agree to that you will have one name to cross off your list.\n\nTake with you a supply of business cards printed in English on one side and Mandarin on the other. Exchange of business cards is more than a business custom it is rather like a ritual.\n\nIt is acceptable to let the potential suppliers know that you will be visiting and that you will contact them on arrival in the city where you will be staying. Having made an appointment after arrival at the hotel, check all travel arrangements necessary to be there on time. The hotel staff will usually help you with this. Travel within Chinese cities can be appallingly slow. Whenever you venture out, always take a few of the hotel\u2019s business cards to give to taxi drivers for your return trip.\n\nIf your prospective supplier is impressed by you, that could result in your visit lasting a couple of hours. If they invite you to lunch, that can take as long as 3 hours.\n\nOnce you arrive at the business premises, you will usually be greeted on arrival by someone who may appear to be a junior staff member, but it is customary for a female staff member to be appointed as your hostess. She will speak good English and her mission is to make you feel like an honored guest while observing strict propriety.\n\nShe will often have some authority to negotiate, but price negotiations on the first contact are not desirable. Do that later in your visit, or even later on your return home. Visits are mostly restricted to the reception area, where you usually drink Jasmine flavored green tea. If you empty your cup, it will be refilled, so unless you love Jasmine flavored green tea, you should only take very small sips. Don't ask for coffee.\n\nAfter a suitable time, which you will have to judge by the flow of conversation, you should ask to visit the factory. If this is on the same premises, you may be sure you are dealing with a manufacturer. If taken to another location, do the following to determine whether or not the people you are dealing with own the factory: Assuming you cannot read Chinese, just compare Chinese characters on signs outside the premises with those on the business card supplied by your hosts. If they match, they are probably genuine manufacturers, but changeable signs are not unknown.\n\nBear in mind that factories are often multistory, with a multitude of businesses in the same building, so there may not be a noticeable sign. In that case ask the factory manager for his card. If this causes embarrassment or he cannot supply one, it strongly suggests that you are dealing with an agent, not directly with the manufacturer.\n\nIf you request a card, you should also offer yours. Ask your hostess, \u201cDo you own this factory?\u201d You will only know the answer is truthful if she says no. If she says yes, you cannot be sure. This is not necessarily due to dishonesty, as she may misunderstand your question, or she may interpret it to mean, \u201cIs this the factory that produces all of your products?\u201d\n\nAs you can see, even when visiting personally, confirming factory ownership is not easy. You could spend a lot less money by employing the services of Intertek (UK) or SGS (Switzerland) for a few hundred dollars and staying home, but you miss out on the delights of tax deductible overseas travel.\n\nTOPIC HEADINGS PREVIOUSLY POSTED IN THIS THREAD:\n\u25a0 Introduction.

Do you know if many of these manufacturers will do Private Labeling?  Did you ever do this?  Once I find the right product, I would like for them to be able to place a logo without greatly increasing cost.  Any thoughts?\n\nA. Internet marketers seem to have found private labeling as the best new thing since sliced bread, but it has been around for many years. Yes, most manufacturers will do private labeling although some are easier than others to deal with. Find one that is cooperative and does not charge excessively.\n\nWhen I was manufacturing industrial products that I exported to China and other Asia Pacific countries, all my exports had my own label, but I also did private labeling for numerous local customers.\n\nThere I am introducing a mild warning\u2026\u2026 I invented an industrial product that also had a big potential market to consumers. I did not promote it, but resellers came to me for the product and they wanted it private labeled. I sold it to any who asked but I did not promise exclusivity to anyone. It went out under at least 18 different labels (from memory), and they were all competing with one another with the identical product.\n\nThe same could happen to you. Only 3 of those businesses succeeded, but they all went on to develop big markets and knowing their retail prices and their purchase volume I can tell you that it was a lucrative business for all of them.\n\nWhen I began importing in 1987, all of my products carried our own label. There were many different products in our range and they came from different factories, so over the years we spent at least $100,000 on set up costs. All our sales direct to business end users wore my brand, but we also produced (in our suppliers\u2019 factories) products bearing our customers\u2019 logos because we knew how to source them and they did not.\n\nPrivate labeling can take many forms, from printed stick on labels, through hot foil stamped logos, screen printing, woven labels, molded silicone labels, stamped and plated metal labels etc\u2026\u2026\n\nSet up cost can vary from $20 for a simple one color print, to $300 for a jacquard needed for a woven label, up to $5,000 or more for an injection mold for debossing or embossing your logo in a generic molded plastic product. As a general rule the label cost or the printing or embossing cost is only a few cents, but a stamped metal logo to attach to your wooden furniture may cost as much as $1 - $5.\n\nFor those interested I suggest that one of the lowest cost private labeling methods is hot foil stamping. It can be used on a wide variety of substrates, but definitely not on metal or cloth. If you want a classy look that will last it needs to be debossed, not embossed, and preferably not have large solid areas of foil print.", "Dicky Dee said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\n@Walter Hay  Thank you for your insight.

On arrival at their US depot, the wrap is removed and the parcels are all sent to the individual recipients and freight is charged at the local rate.\n\nHope this helps.", "Q & A 5.\n\nThis is a question from a person to whom I had been explaining how escrow works.\n\nQ. So sir,\n\nIt means i have the advantage of checking the products before releasing the money? meaning i pay alibaba 100% then alibaba hold the funds until i say that the product delivered by the seller is working and in good condition?\n\nthen its a good concept and safe way of doing business also the 5% is nothing compared to the safety of our transaction.\n\nCorrect?\n\nA. That is correct. It one of the safest ways to do business, but the big drawback is that you must not let a supplier keep you in discussion until the time limit runs out. That is a strategy that has often been reported.\n\nThe Escrow rules published by Alibaba are very complex and it is difficult to get the full story on their site.\n\nI suggest you go to the Alibaba site, click on For Buyers, then under Trade Services, click Escrow. On next page click on Learn More in the section \"What is Alibaba's Escrow Service?\" Next page click on FAQ. Next page look at the Dispute section on the right.\n\nTake special note of the section \"How do I make a refund request?\" You are expected to negotiate with the supplier, and if no resolution after 30 days the matter automatically goes to mediation. See also the time limits in the section \"How do I Open a Dispute?\"\n\nWhile there is no mention of the fact that you must complete negotiations within a certain time, I strongly recommend that you ask for mediation if you have not been given a firm and positive answer by the supplier within 10 days of opening a dispute.\n\nI have received many sad tales about Alibaba paying the supplier because the dispute had not been escalated within the required time. That required time used to be published on their site, but I am currently unable to find it.\n\nSome of the recent changes to their site have not been done competently and if you click on certain buttons in your escrow search you will find the page not available.\n\nRather than use Alibaba's escrow service that I believe is weight too heavily in favor of the seller, I suggest you tell suppliers that you want to use escrow.com and that you will pay the escrow fee.  Many will say no, largely because they don't know escrow.com, so you will need to show them details of that company's financial registrations in various states.\n\nEscrow.com's fees are very high for very small transactions, but a lot lower than Alipay when the transaction is for $2,000 or more. There is an online calculator on their site but just to give you some idea, here is what their escrow protection will cost you, including a a flat rate service fee of $25.\n$200         25.0%\n$500         10.0%\n$1,000        5.7%\n$2,000        4.5%\n$10,000      2.0%\n\nBy using escrow.com you can be sure of safety in the transaction.\n\nOn transactions of $10,000 or more it is cheaper than what most banks would charge for processing an L/C.", "Parallel Imports USA\n\nIs there a legal way to import well-known brands into the USA for resale? The answer in brief is: If a product or a brand does not have a CBP Recordation number displayed on the USBC website it SHOULD be safe for you to import that product or brand, but please read the entire post before you order!\n\nThere are many big brand products that can be purchased overseas, even at retail, at prices way below the retail price in the USA.\n\nIt is vital to appreciate that there is absolutely no way you can safely or legally import imitations, counterfeits, or knockoffs. Even items that look like big brand items may be confiscated by the US CBP Service. Reconditioned big brand items may suffer the same fate.\n\nBefore proceeding please understand that this article is not intended as legal advice, and the author accepts no liability for any outcome resulting from acting upon any matter or matters referred to in the article.\n\nThis post is specific to the USA, but if there is sufficient interest I might be persuaded to write about the issue in relation to other countries.\n\nFirst: What are parallel imports? Parallel imports (also known as gray market goods) refers to genuine branded goods that are imported into a market and sold there without the consent of the owner of the trademark.\n\nThe goods are \u201cgenuine\u201d goods (as distinct from counterfeit goods) in that they have been manufactured by or for or under license from the brand owner.\n\nHowever, they may have been designed with small differences, or even packaged differently for a particular jurisdiction, but then imported into another jurisdiction (USA). This can lead to the presence of what is called a material difference.  What you might consider is a trivial difference can be classed as material by CBP or a court of law.\n\nHere are some of the things that courts have determined constitute material differences:\n\n\u00b7  Packaging differences, including absence of certain familiar markings;\n\u00b7  Product appearance, even a slight difference in shape or distinctive color;\n\u00b7  Difference in smell;\n\u00b7  Different appearance of labels;\n\u00b7  Missing legislated labeling requirements;\n\u00b7  If it is food, beverage, cosmetic etc., different ingredients.\n\nA material difference is one that consumers familiar with the brand would notice and consider relevant to their decision to buy.  If a consumer is familiar with a branded product, and after purchasing a parallel import notices that the product\u2019s characteristics are inconsistent with his or her previous purchases, the consumer may begin to doubt that he or she has purchased a genuine product.\n\nThese differences are important because of potential damage to the brand owner\u2019s image or reputation.\n\nWhy Try Parallel Importing?\n\nOne of the best ways to answer this is to say that according to the World Health Organization, Bayer sell ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic) in India for $15 per 100 units (500 mg) but in Mozambique they charge $740.\n\nThe clear reason is that there is absolutely no competition in Mozambique, but there is a huge amount of competition in India. Wow! What an opportunity! Or is it? ..........\n\nNow don\u2019t rush to buy ciprofloxacin in India and try to sell it in the US. Pharmaceuticals are one of many product categories subject to specific legislation that would make it impossible. There are other branded products that are either impossible to import or can only be purchased as parallel imports if certain very tight rules are observed.\n\nAbout 5 years  ago, in a U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Customs Bulletin, the agency announced that it was applying the \u201cLever rule\u201d (a landmark court ruling in the case Lever Bros. Co. v. United States, 1993) to cover certain brands of watches. Importation of the watches is now forbidden unless they bear labels warning potential purchasers that they are \u201cphysically and materially\u201d different from watches normally sold in the United States under those trademarks.\n\nThis ruling applies to many product categories, and consequently anyone considering parallel importing should seek expert advice. Experienced Customs Brokers should be able to identify which products have been specifically listed as restricted gray market goods.\n\nIt is possible to conduct a search on the CBP site located at: http://iprs.cbp.gov/ and find the Intellectual Property Rights Search (IPRS) page. Enter the brand name in the \"Keyword\" box and if that brand has requested and been granted gray market protection, a CBP Recordation number will be displayed. If one clicks on the entry under the second column, which is labeled \"Title Product\", on the brand name, the CBP Recordation opens up to another screen and displays more details.\n\nSo, the message of value amounts to this: If a product or a brand does not have a CBP Recordation number displayed it SHOULD  be safe for you to import that product or brand.\n\nAlthough I have provided that search information I can assure my readers that I would not personally rely solely upon those results. If your Customs Broker cannot give you a definite answer, it would be unwise to proceed with parallel importing without obtaining legal advice.\n\nJust a word of caution: If you intend relying on any expert or legal advice, you must have that advice in writing.\n\nIs Parallel Importing Worth the Trouble?\n\nThat is a decision for each one individually, but if you obtain sound expert advice that gives you a definite assurance that you are on safe ground, parallel importing can be extremely lucrative.\n\nIn some countries where government protection of big business interests is not as great as it is in the US, parallel importing is actively encouraged. Japan and New Zealand are two notable examples, where there is a thriving market for parallel imports and some quite large businesses have grown up around that business model.\n\nIt is always necessary to do your research before beginning any enterprise, but in the case of parallel importing, thorough research is absolutely essential, but I believe there is so much profit potential that time spent on research could be handsomely rewarded.\n\nJust think; Do you think the manufacturers, (Bayer) are selling at below cost in India? No it would not cost them anywhere near $15 to produce 500 gm. (just over 1 lb.) of ciprofloxacin. After all, Indian manufacturers are profitably selling the same antibiotic at around that price. Bayer is also no doubt selling at a profit at $15, yet they found a market (Mozambique) where they can sell the same product for $740.\n\nYou may not find such extreme price differences for products that interest you, but huge differences do exist. Maybe you can capitalize on that.\n\nTOPIC HEADINGS PREVIOUSLY POSTED IN THIS THREAD:\n\u25a0 Introduction.

Most businesses in China trade under at least 3 different names and I have known some with as many as 10 names. The practice of trading in other products is very common. In fact I used to do it myself, when satisfied customers would ask for products outside of our usual product range.\n\nThe expression \"maybe our DHL agent send the products under other company's name\" is not much cause for concern when you understand Chinese use of language. \"Maybe\" can be an all-embracing way of saying \"The simple fact is that we use DHL's services under the name of one of our companies and that is why a different name appears on the AWB.\" You can be sure that because they had to pay the freight bill, they know exactly which company name was used.\n\n2. The simplest way to negotiate softly is to obtain competitive quotes and use them in non forceful way. It helps if you can scan and email a copy of a competitor's quote, but it is best to obscure all identifying printing including company name, address, phone/fax numbers, logo, etc.\n\nWhen using a competitor's quote to try to get a better price, you should mildly compliment the supplier you are negotiating with, and add that you would prefer to deal with them because of those good points, but you must consider the costs.\n\nBecause you have already given away a negotiating point with your praise, they will rarely match that price but they will often lower the price to a compromise level. The praise is used to help cement your relationship, and in my opinion the risk of not getting them to lower the price all the way to match the competitor is worth it if you believe you have found a really good supplier.\n\n3. There will always be an issue of opportunity cost. That is, the value to you of the money you have outlaid while you wait for delivery. With air freight you get to turn that money into sales a lot faster than if you use sea freight. \n\nDepending on order size, air freight can sometimes cost a lot less than sea freight. Once you reach container load quantities, that is almost impossible. Always remember the distinction between air freight and air courier service. Air freight does not automatically include pick up from supplier, customs clearance, or delivery to your door. It should be arranged through a freight forwarder.\n\n4. My crystal ball is slightly cloudy, but I do see big movements away from China. Many Chinese companies are now doing what Taiwanese companies did about 20 years ago, and that is they are starting to look for low labor cost countries. A large number of Taiwanese companies transferred their manufacturing to mainland China.\n\nSome of them are now moving again, looking at other Asian countries but also Africa. Chinese owned companies are doing likewise. I don't see great opportunities for importers because the manufacturers will continue to be the old hands at the game. The only benefit will be the maintaining of low prices.\n\nWalter", "ljb7 said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nWalter,\n\nI'm stuck trying to find the manufacturer for a product I've bought. I'm 95% sure I'm dealing with a trader (albeit good) at the moment and want to get this price down.\n\nI've scoured the sites you recommend. The company I'm dealing with isn't 'compliance verified' on the one site, and isn't on the other great site. It is on Alibaba though.\n\nI would really appreciate your help so I can dig deeper and find the original manufacturer without potentially destroying the relationship I have with the existing trader, because they are a little too pricey but still provide great service.\n\nThank you!Click to expand...\n\nIt can often be very difficult to locate the real manufacturer of a specific product. It is always possible that the manufacturer is small, and does not have an export license or does not want to be bothered with the hassles of exporting.\n\nIf that is the case you may have no option but to deal with the trader.\n\nI would be happy to check them out for you if you care to give me their name confidentially. You could do so by starting a conversation. \n\nIf they are in fact the manufacturer, you will have to slowly work on them to get a better price. Sometimes you can get other concessions such as lower freight charges or upgraded packaging.", "As promised I checked them out, and without any doubt your supplier is not the manufacturer. See our conversation to find the real manufacturer's identity.\n\nFor the benefit of others, but without disclosing anything that will identify your niche I will just make a few points.\n\nSome suppliers sell a range of products that are all closely related and the whole range is needed in order to provide a complete package. These suppliers can't possibly manufacture the whole range, although they might have started off manufacturing one category within their range.\n\nFor the convenience of sourcing a package from one supplier you can expect to pay more. If you only want to buy a product that is just a part, and not the whole package, it would pay to do some more searching to find the actual manufacturer of that product.\n\nThis is what I have done for you now. As you know it only took me a few minutes.\n\nThis leads me to provide a hint on how to search B2B platforms. Explore different keywords and different combinations of keywords. For example you may want to buy a combination bath and shower made of acrylic.\n\nSearch possibilities are:\nAcrylic tubs.\nAcrylic baths.\nAcrylic showers.\nAcrylic combination bath and shower.\nBath tubs.\nShower tubs.\nTubs.\nShowers.\n\nThere are actually a whole lot more possibilities and your success can depend on how persistent you are.\n\nIt is also worth noting that some B2B sites will not recognize (American spelling) a word if it is spelt using American English and others won't recognise (British spelling) a word if it is spelt in British English.", "Thanks a lot, I appreciate the help Walter.", "Q & A 6.\n\nQ. Can I get my shipments delivered by airfreight with duty paid?\n\nA. People often mix up the terms airfreight and air couriers and I suspect that you may mean air courier not air freight.\n\nAirfreight with duty paid refers to the INCOTERM DDP which means delivered, duty paid. It is a term occasionally quoted by suppliers, but not by freight companies and it is very rarely offered. If you have ever been quoted those terms you would be the exception rather than the rule for the simple reason that overseas suppliers do not want to take the risk of paying more duty than they expected to when they quoted you.\n\nTo clarify the matter, I think you mean using a freight service that includes clearance through Customs and payment of duty on your behalf. This can be done two ways:\n\nUse a freight forwarder who has included door to door delivery and customs clearance in his quote.(Make sure the quote is in writing.) The clearance service also invariably involves payment of duty and tax (if applicable) on your behalf. You then pay the forwarder and they deliver the goods to you.\nUse a door to door air courier service. This can be arranged by you or by your supplier. Just like the freight forwarder service I describe, it also normally involves payment of duty and tax (if applicable) on your behalf. You then pay the air courier and they deliver the goods to you.\nNeither of these services meets the description DDP, but they do achieve what you want to do.\n\nAll intending importers should be aware that it is not possible to know in advance the exact amount of duty payable. Your Freight Forwarder or Customs Broker should be able to give you a close estimate, but there are variables that can result in Customs imposing a lot more or a lot less duty than even those experts would expect. This is one good reason why suppliers would very rarely be willing to quote DDP.\n\nTOPIC HEADINGS PREVIOUSLY POSTED IN THIS THREAD:\n\u25a0 Introduction.

How much of the rules and regulations do you really have to learn before it is safe to start importing? Like, I looked up the Customs site and it is scary.\n\nA. I don\u2019t blame you. For someone new to the industry it must be very scary. There are thousands of pages of rules and regulations and the worst part is that they are changing all the time.\n\nThose constant changes were a big factor in me deciding that although I was qualified to handle my own Customs clearances, I would leave that to others to do for me. I figured that my time was better spent sourcing, importing, and selling, rather than reading, reading, and reading, just to stay up to date.\n\nIt was also more cost effective for me to pay someone else to do the work for me than to do it myself.\n\nI certainly did not have enough shipment volume to set up the online links to Customs that are used by Customs brokers to streamline the process. A broker can lodge a clearance quickly, sometimes in a matter of seconds, and rarely would it take more than a few minutes.\n\nYou will have already worked out from my answer that you barely need to know any of the rules, and that I would advise using the services of a Customs broker to do the clearances for you.\n\nThere is one rule you must learn. You are legally responsible for the facts declared in any declaration lodged for clearance purposes. Even if your broker makes an error, you are legally responsible. \n\nOne area that few consider in this respect is declared value. It is almost universal practise for Asian suppliers to under declare the shipment value, thinking they are doing you a favour. When shipping documents arrive in advance of the shipment reaching your country, you should check the invoice value, and notify your broker if the value is not correct.\n\nIt is preferable to instruct your suppliers in advance that you will not accept invoices for less than the true value.\n\nTOPIC HEADINGS PREVIOUSLY POSTED IN THIS THREAD:\n\u25a0 Introduction.

I also exported to other Asia Pacific countries during that time.\n\nFirst I must say that exporting is much more difficult than importing. Finding prospective buyers can be very time consuming. Once you have located good prospects, it is imperative to make a personal visit, and for each contact you will need to allow at least 3 days. The first day will be largely socializing, including dining out and being entertained. You should stay at a top hotel in order to impress.\n\nYou will be obliged to work through an interpreter. This is because that puts you at a disadvantage when negotiating! Your Chinese associates will talk freely among themselves and your interpreter will not interpret what they say. He/she will only interpret what they want you to hear.\n\nThe biggest obstacle you will face is actually locating prospects. To do this there are several possibilities. You could contact the World Trade Center in Beijing. https://www.wtca.org/locations/china-world-trade-center-beijing?locale=en.They are much easier to communicate with than the one in Shanghai. Be prepared for a long delay in getting any response. The alternative is to register as a vendor on Alibaba. I know I knock Alibaba as a site for buyers to use, but for sellers it is unbeatable. I am still a registered vendor there, although I have not sold anything for years.\n\nCurrently you can buy Gold Supplier status for $699 instead of the usual $2,999. You will receive numerous buyer requests, most of which will be from opportunists who operate from a residential apartment and do not even have an office. If they appear to have an office you will need to check the address to see if it is a serviced office, or if it is one they rent permanently, otherwise you may waste a lot of time on someone with no resources. Use a throw-away email address. gmail is OK, but one with your domain name is better, even if the domain name is throw-away.\n\nI found my Chinese agent through my agent in Taiwan. I found the agent in Taiwan through the World Trade Center in Taipei. The WTC in Taipei is extremely active, and contacting them could well lead you to a Taiwanese company that has appropriate contacts in mainland China, so it is well worth a try. Many Taiwanese businessmen have business links to the mainland.\n\nIf you need more details, please just ask.", "It's because of guys like Walter Hay that this forum has so much value!

Your duty and sales tax will be calculated on that total figure.\n\nIf you are selling in a jurisdiction that requires you to charge Sales Tax, you then have to charge your customer the local sales tax rate, but that has no connection to the sales tax that the Customs dept may impose when you import.\n\nIt is a serious crime to understate the value.

I agree that an email fromm your own website address is much more likely to produce a good response. If you can't do that, gmail would be preferable to the other free addresses because many businesses are now using gmail. The general format for first contact emails as provide by afterjoule is very good.\n\nljb7 is also right about payment methods. PayPal gives you a lot of protection. Escrow provided by Alibaba has considerable drawbacks in my opinion, but is still much better than risking payment via WU or moneygram.

BPOM registration will involve a big commitment by the US company, so they need to have confidence that your appointment would be of great benefit to them.\n\nHave you found out what BPOM registration will cost? In Indonesia registration must be applied for by the US company through a local sole agent unless the US company sets up a legal entity in the country.  If a local agent is appointed government regulations limit that to 5 years.\n\nThis leaves open the possibility that if you are successful the US company might terminate your license and set up their own business in Indonesia after you have done all the hard work.\n\nCalling them is not likely to result in you making contact with the right person unless it is a very small business, so your first contact will need to be to find out who is the person you should talk to. Don't expect to then be immediately connected to that person. When you get their name, ask the person that you are talking to when would be the best time to call.\n\nYou will need to have a business plan worked out so that you can send it to the executive immediately after your discussion.\n\nYou may get a good start if the business is currently looking for export markets.

I expect to post it later today.\n\nYou will have noted that Alibaba is one of my least favorite sourcing platforms, mainly because it is so difficult to determine if you are really dealing with a manufacturer, but for those who like to use it, here is an important hint: Use a big variety of keywords in your search. For example, if you are looking for acrylic key chains, you could search for...... acrylic, acrylic key chains, acrylic key rings, plastic key rings, plastic key chains, key chains, key rings, promotional key chains, promotional key rings.\n\nThis is important because Alibaba's search function is quite limited at times. Also, as you will see above, I have used both US and British keywords (key chains, key rings). There is also the limitation caused by lack of vocabulary on the part of the suppliers. Much patience is required.\n\nAlthough Alibaba has a massive number of suppliers listed, with millions of products, there are many more suppliers who don't list there, and many more products that are not listed there either. \n\nI could have made  a lot of money as a a product sourcing agent because I know where to find virtually any product imaginable, but I have chosen to teach others how to do it for themselves and save lots of money in the process.", "Sourcing Agents and Quality Control\n\nThere are quite a few importing information sites operated by people wanting to sell their services as sourcing agents, sometimes including quality control inspections. Some of the big B2B websites have advertisers offering those services.\n\nThe information provided on those information sites is heavily skewed to worry intending importers so that they will believe that unless they use the services of a reliable sourcing agent they are courting disaster. The things that generate income for them are fear and ignorance.\n\nThe pitch is that if you go it alone in product sourcing you won\u2019t know who is a reliable supplier and you may finish up paying for faulty goods.\n\nHowever if you employ someone such as (here insert the name of the sourcing agent operating the site or affiliated with it) you can sleep soundly, knowing that they will eliminate every risk for you.\n\nIt sounds good in theory, but who polices the policeman? Are they really working for you, or are they secretly working for the supplier?\n\nThis is not theory. Don\u2019t forget that I have been importing since 1987 and I know it happens. Sourcing agents sometimes work on commission from the suppliers, and sometimes they charge you a commission. In reality, sometimes they get both, but they will never tell you that. Sometimes the great supplier they find is a relative or friend.\n\nStraight out quality control services do exist and some of them, particularly those based in Europe have a fine reputation. In my post \u201cInspection Services\u201d yesterday I listed a number of utterly reliable independent inspection services.\n\nThe problem is that for small businesses their charges can soak up too much of the possible profit. A small shipment inspection will cost about $250 to $350 provided the inspection service is located in the city where the manufacturer is located. Most of the big European inspection services do have branches in the main manufacturing centers throughout China, so most are covered.\n\nOnce you get to the point of ordering in the five figure or more range, inspection services may be well worthwhile. Some of those companies will also provide sourcing services, but I believe that doing it yourself can be a very safe process and can save you hundreds and even thousands of dollars.\n\nSince retiring due to a botched operation, I have taught hundreds of people how to source safely. Prior to that, I ran my importing and marketing business for 22 years. I appointed franchisees in 4 countries and my franchise was an unusual system. I did not supply products to any franchisee. Instead I taught them how to find the products they wanted to sell.\n\nA large part of the royalties they paid me was my reward for the successful B2B marketing system I taught them, but without safe product sourcing direct from manufacturers who would give them incredibly low prices, they could not have afforded those royalties.\n\nNone of those franchisees ever used a sourcing agent, even with orders as large as $50,000. None of them ever reported being scammed. All of them enjoyed huge profits. In other words, use of a sourcing agent was totally unnecessary because they knew all about safe sourcing practice and safe sourcing sites.\n\nTOPIC HEADINGS PREVIOUSLY POSTED IN THIS THREAD:\n\u25a0 Introduction.

According to an article by Bloomberg, 35% of registered vendors on Globalsources don\u2019t renew after their first year. It is worth noting that is almost exactly the same as the number who quit Alibaba.\n\nThis high attrition rate highlights the fact that it is critically important to be able to have confidence in the verification and rating system used.\n\nI began using Global Sources for product sourcing long before the advent of the internet.  They published numerous printed product sourcing magazines, and I was a registered subscriber. There was no verification system then. If an advertiser could afford to pay, their advertisement would appear in the magazines.\n\nHas anything changed? NO\u2026.. I had allowed my vendor registration on Globalsources to lapse so I set out to register again recently in order to update my knowledge of their system. The process was too easy. Without any verification procedure I was immediately awarded a 3 STAR rating, about which they say \u201cStart as a 3-star advertiser to win buyers' trust fast.\u201d\n\nStrictly speaking there might be a verification procedure. They say they will send a contracted person to my address to collect a check. At least that would prove that I exist. They say they will visit my premises 3 times to verify, but instead they sent me an email telling me that their representative (in another country) would phone me. I am certain that he is not going to take a flight 5 hours each way on one occasion let alone three.\n\nHere are quotes from a couple of complaints lodged online referring to the \u201cverification\u201d and rating system that the two complainants relied on to find suppliers they could trust:\n\n\u201cI have direct experience with GlobalSources.com and have proof in writing from senior executives in a series of emails where GlobalSources.com admitted the \u2018rating\u2019 system they call \u2018verified supplier\u2019 is based entirely upon how much money they collect from the supplier and nothing more.\u201d \n\n\u201cI have $6,000 worth of fake cards sitting at home. The reason I went with Global Sources is that they are supposed to be more reliable than Alibaba. Based on my experience, they are as bad. The ratings on there, from my experience, are a joke and people should be very, very wary.\u201d\n\nRecently one of my book readers asked if it was safe to use an unverified supplier. The real fact is that on almost every popular B2B site there is near enough to zero benefit in dealing only with a \u201cverified\u201d supplier, and no greater benefit in dealing with a Gold, Premium, 4 Star etc\u2026\u2026 supplier, because the security offered by the rating systems they use is mainly an illusion.\n\n\nTOPIC HEADINGS PREVIOUSLY POSTED IN THIS THREAD:\n\u25a0 Introduction.

The documents from my forwarder in China say CFR Long Beach CA. So do I need a Customs Broker to clear Customs here?\n\nA. You will need more than the services of a customs broker. There will be a variety of charges once the container reaches Long Beach and from there to the point where you take delivery.\n\nYou have a couple of choices to make now, but each will cost you quite a lot.\n\n1.  Appoint a customs broker to clear the shipment.  Arrange with a trucking company to collect the container and deliver to you. Make sure the trucking company regularly does port pickups. If they are not regulars, the driver will possibly have to sleep overnight in his truck before being allowed entry to load because he will be treated as an outsider. They should quote you for payment for port charges on your behalf and then they will collect those from you as part of their service.\n\n2.  Appoint a local freight forwarder to clear the shipment using their in-house customs agent, and arrange to have your container collected from the port and delivered to you. This would be my preferred option rather than try to synchronize clearance by one party and pick up by another. A freight forwarder also knows the importance of quick clearance and pick up to avoid extra costs.\n\nI expect that the big cost saving on sea freight will be eaten up by these extra charges. Because your supplier has quoted you FOB Shanghai, I recommend that for future shipments you arrange shipping on a DAP (Specify your address) basis, because that will cover all of those costs from Shanghai to your warehouse.\n\nSee Chapter 3 for how to find a local freight forwarder.", "Q & A  9.

In fact it may be possible to get a better deal from them than you could elsewhere.\n\nIt will often be the case that free advertisers (unverified) have products that are not being offered elsewhere, and this can be a huge benefit to you because of the lack of competition, so the extra work could be very worthwhile.\n\nYou will need to search for their names in every possible way in order to get as much information as possible about them.

Obtain quotes and keep them on file.\n\nYou can then respond to notices of price increases by saying that you have another supplier who has quoted you $....

The products looked alike, but when I personally delivered the repaired items along with one of ours that had been faulty, I was able to show the difference. The result was that we had a customer for life because we went the extra mile and gave more than could possibly be expected.\n\nNow back to your question .... I always looked for products that were either not subject to a large amount of competition, or where the market was dominated by suppliers who could not care less about their customers, or where product improvements were possible.\n\nGenerally you won't find such opportunities among the Amazon Best Sellers list, although if you look at that list from the perspective I have outlined, maybe you will. \n\nThere is a big benefit in browsing printed sourcing magazines. You will find some offered on a couple of the sites that I have listed in my book. Quickly flicking through the pages can give you ideas that might not otherwise occur to you. They offer online versions but unless they have flip pages, you should opt for the print version, because browsing page by page is quicker than searching categories.", "Misinformation is a Wealth Hazard.\n\nReviewing some \u201cinformation\u201d websites, eBooks, and posts on various forums relating to importing.\n\nI don\u2019t intend naming names, but if anyone is seriously interested in checking some of the \u201cinformation\u201d sources I am reviewing I will provide details privately.\n\nMany of the people who publish misinformation rely for their income on those who would believe it if you told them that Webster\u2019s had removed the word gullible from their latest edition. They tend to accept what they read because the person is an \u201cexpert.\u201d\n\nI have looked at some of the \u201csuccess\u201d stories of people selling exciting books teaching \u201chow to import\u201d and I have found not just exaggeration, but plain old BS. But then, a lot of people adopt the approach: \u201cWhy let the facts spoil a good story?\u201d\n\nYou know how it works\u2026. They give you a free teaser that contains pages of stuff about how they made a fortune importing small quantities, usually from China, and selling on eBay,  Amazon, etc., then, when you are all excited they throw in a special offer to upgrade to the paid version.\n\nBut what have you been reading? Mark-ups of thousands % on items that they have been able to sell like hot scones.\n\nDo yourself a favor, and before buying the special offer up-sell, do some checking. I did that for you because I know a lot of people never bother, they just accept what is written.\n\nLet me give you a real example from a popular free eBook, offered like so many are, on an \u201cexpert\u2019s\u201d blog.\n\nHere\u2019s what was being taught: Buy X00 units of product XYZ from sites such as Alibaba, Aliexpress, etc., and pay only $0.75 each including postage from China. Sell for $13.50 and you will have the lot sold very fast, so you can order more and repeat the process, with a mark-up of about 1800%.\n\nHere\u2019s the reality: The product XYZ was clearly identified and I easily found it on Aliexpress, now slightly cheaper than what the free book said. I then went to eBay, and found the identical product selling, not for $13.50, but $1.95 with free postage. Mark-up 278% but that does not take into account the reseller\u2019s selling costs which could include eBay or Amazon costs, PayPal and postage. A huge amount of work and risk for such a poor return when those costs are deducted.\n\nI know that I have written in an earlier post that there were some products on which I and my former franchisees were happy to accept as low as 250% mark-up, but that was when we sold the items B2B by the hundreds or by thousands, not one at a time on eBay. I encourage new importers to look for high margin products and not stop their searching until they find something that will give them those margins.\n\nSome of these free eBooks I have looked at contain some very good information, but they also contain some very bad advice. A lot of the information in some of them is obsolete too.\n\nIt is not only in eBooks that you find misinformation that is not only wrong but potentially hazardous to your wealth.\n\nHere are a couple of items from posts and blog articles by \u201cexperts\u201d I have found on forums and from How to Import information sites:\n\n\u201cI mainly use Aliexpress although I have used dhgate before, they are basically the same website.\u201d .......\nThat is plain ignorance. Those sites are totally unrelated.\n\n\u201cEven better, they\u2026. have onsite inspections from Alibaba.\u201d  .......\nEvery verified supplier has had an onsite inspection and it just proves that the business exists, so that is not better in any way.\n\n\u201cDON\u2019T buy from non-gold members. Just following this rule will help you to avoid 98% of the scams and bad suppliers.\u201d .......\nI will soon post an article about gold member scams, because dealing with gold suppliers is no guarantee you will not be scammed.\n\n\u201cAnother option is AliExpress.com, Alibaba\u2019s site for smaller orders.\u201d .......\nAliexpress is a retail site. It is not Alibaba\u2019s  site for small orders. With the right approach you should be able to buy small quantities on Alibaba at lower prices than you would pay on Aliexpress.\n\n\u201cIf the company has a verified profile on Global Sources, chances of it being a scam are reduced to an absolute minimum as unlike Alibaba, Global Sources takes it\u2019s verification process very seriously and there are stringent requirements for authentication. So depending on the number of stars a supplier has on Global Sources, you can be sure that you\u2019re dealing with a real company.\u201d  ........\nSee my recent article about GlobalSources. They do not take their verification process any more seriously than Alibaba do. Stars are bought, not earned.\n\nI could quote a lot more, but I don\u2019t want to seem too negative. The main point of this post is to warn that people calling themselves experts who publish eBooks, run training courses, host webinars, post on forums are often (to me) obviously not experts at all, so do your own research to the best of your ability, don\u2019t just rely on experts unless you can be very confident that they do really know what they are talking about.\n\nThat applies to me also. Before you take as gospel everything or anything I say you should check out some of the information I have provided. Have I been able to answer every question or have I avoided the issue? Have you checked at least some of my answers to see if they are correct?

That is what is known in the importing world as \"indent selling\". What you do is first locate a good supplier and then offer the product to businesses that use that product. When you get an order, they must pay you in advance, usually by L/C. You can then use that L/C as collateral with the bank to obtain your own L/C to pay your supplier.\n\nI know it sounds like an ideal way to do business but it is hard to convince people these days to buy on indent because doing their own importing is now much easier for them. There is also a risk that they will bypass you for repeat orders, so you only get one-off sales.\n\nIn my post Oct 7 in answer to a question by Simon Ashari, I described how I started my 2 main businesses.

It involves paying for a good inspection service, so that is really only suitable if your order value is at least $2,000. An alternative is to require that they accept payment by escrow, but beware of the time limits and intricate rules of Alibaba's escrow system.\n\nIn the case of samples, I believe it is important to let every supplier know at a very early stage that quality is important to you. That may result in them just carefully testing the samples, but that leaves the risk that they will not do the same for a larger order quantity.\n\nTo minimize that risk you speak plainly but very politely  when preparing to place your larger order. Tell them that provided their QC continues to be as good as it was with the sample order they can expect long term repeat business. As your experience shows, the support is usually good, so most suppliers will make that extra effort to keep you happy.\n\nAlthough you may have escaped being scammed I would still avoid using Alibaba because of the verification system's deficiencies. Gold membership is worthless as an indicator of reliability or capability. Onsite Checked likewise. I just now did a random search for bicycles, limiting the search to Assessed Suppliers. Here is what I found:\n\nThe business is a 9 year Gold Supplier.\nThe business has two Assessed Supplier reports, both are out of date.\nThe reports identify the supplier as a trading company, with premises being 130 m. sq.  but in their own profile the company claims to be a manufacturer, with premises between 10,000 and 30,000 m.sq.\nOn their website they claim that they have been manufacturing for 24 years, but on the same site they say the business was established in the year 2000.\nIn their Alibaba profile they claim sales 20 times greater than the figure they claim on their website.\nTheir .cn website does not display an ICP number, and that is illegal.\nI assure you this search was truly random. I have never before heard of this company. When a supplier has such conflicting claims and reports on a 9 year Gold Supplier who has had Onsite Checking and is an Assessed Supplier, it gives little reason to be confident in the verification system used by Alibaba.\n\nRegardless of how you locate your suppliers it is vital to build a good relationship with them. For the benefit of all who read this post, don't miss out on sending \"Season's\" greetings, Western New Year greetings and later, Chinese New Year greetings to your suppliers, as part of the relationship building and maintaining process.\n\nA good relationship is often the best QC you can get.", "Freight Options\n\nWhen getting quotes, importers should look at various freight possibilities. Sea freight, air freight, door to door courier are all options to consider. Suppliers will invariably quote FOB, but therein lies a possible trap.\n\nFOB is a universal shipping term. These are commonly known as Incoterms. FOB means Free On Board at the port of shipping, but the term is widely misused in China, sometimes intentionally, and sometimes out of ignorance. You must have the terms clarified before committing to an order.\n\nIf a supplier states FOB works or FOB factory, that is not a proper use of the term. They should say Ex Works (EXW). The cost difference can be huge because inland charges in China from factory to port of loading can be very high. I would never accept a quote FOB factory or EXW. FOB quotes are very often FOB factory, so watch out for that trap.\n\nDoor to door courier service can be organized for you by the supplier, or you can arrange it through your own courier. Often you will find that suppliers in China can get much better rates than you can get, so always get a quote from both ends. Suppliers may quote a high courier rate for a sample, but for continuing orders they could usually offer a much better rate.\n\nFor the other freight options, sea freight and air freight, I would strongly recommend only working through your local freight forwarder.\n\nDepending on the type of product, its weight, and dimensions, it may pay to use air rather than sea freight. Serious importers will take into account the opportunity cost of having their money tied up in a container at sea for weeks compared to days by air.\n\nI teach my own version of a \"Just In Time\" ordering system which involves the use of door to door air courier services. This depends for success on several factors. Buying at the right price so that courier costs can be covered. Getting your suppliers to agree to repeat small orders. Getting the best courier rates. Keeping track of sales and your own sales trends so that you can re-order in time.\n\n\"Just In Time\" allows you to minimize inventory, and in the process it also minimizes the risk of having a lot of dead stock if the market suddenly changes.\n\nTOPIC HEADINGS PREVIOUSLY POSTED IN THIS THREAD:\n\u25a0 Introduction.

This newbie is totally confused, and in addition to my published answer I have sent him a PM to try to rescue him because he is about to lose a lot of money.\n\nQ. Hello all, I am new to importing and will become an import expert with time.\n\nI am starting a company and importing a product from China (Shenzhen). The market responds well to this particular product so that's not the problem. I am not sure of the exact process for importing and I've read all the threads on this forum, but experience is always better than reading tons of info.\n\nMy question is with the big importing companies out there, DHL, FedEx and UPS. Which of these supplies the best value and simplicity for importing a product from China? From getting the product to getting it to my company location?\n\nThe manufacturer is FOB: Port Shenzhen. I would like to get this product sooner than via ship since it's almost the holiday season. Since their terms are FOB, can I use an agent of some sort to go from FOB Shenzhen to Air? I live in Cincinnati Ohio and would like to go FOB Shenzhen to Air Hong Kong to Cincinnati Ohio. I believe I will be using DHL for this but wanted ideas to make this easier and cost effective. Product is only about $1500 USD at most.\n\nI have not requested other means of shipment with the supplier due to the quote being FOB. I will ask door to door. With DHL, will they cover all the customs clearance, and everything else logistically speaking once I give the manufacturer an account, I will update the quote from them and see if they are able to air express via door to door.\n\nA. Relying only on information found on forums can lead you to learning by very expensive experience. There are many publications available online (not only mine) to teach you what you need to know. If you are willing to risk $1500 to gain experience; that is up to you, but for a few dollars you might be able to learn by other people\u2019s experience. Let someone else make the mistakes and bear the cost of those mistakes. For your own sake, please get some real help from someone - anyone - who actually knows something about importing. You could probably get more valuable help from DHL, FedEx, or UPS than you will find on forums. Give them a call and ask what should you do.\n\nDHL, FedEx and UPS are not importing companies, they are carriers. They can pick up your goods and deliver to your door, but before you commit to an order, get proper quotes first. It is quite possible that freight on your $1500 shipment could be more than $1500!\n\nYou do not want an agent to \u201cgo from FOB Shenzhen to Air Hong Kong\u2026.\u201d. You either want to have a freight forwarder organize the whole process from the point of collection at the supplier\u2019s factory through to delivery to your address, or you want a courier company to do the same.\n\nYou do not have to accept the supplier\u2019s standard quote of FOB Shenzhen.  Ask them to quote you for door to door air courier, but the quote must include Customs clearance. Once you pick your jaw up off the floor, you can then ask your local freight forwarder to quote you for air freight door to door (Not air courier door to door). This quote must be in writing and must include Customs clearance. It will be cheaper than air courier, but a bit slower.", "Hi Walter, thank you for doing this AMA it has been very helpful to the community.\n\nI have been pondering trying my hand at importing products from afar.

Unfortunately, for many of those sites that I refer to as offspring of Chinese or Indian sourcing sites, there is no way that I can suggest using them that is not without significant risk.", "B2B Scams.\n\nThe popular B2B sourcing sites attract not only legitimate businesses but also many professional scammers from various countries, not only China. Scamming is big business, with thousands of scams being reported every year.\n\nThe biggest problem from my point of view is that most B2B sites are not providing realistic verification of suppliers and this leaves great opportunities for those who know the simple procedures that are needed in order to look genuine. Here is a comment on this subject by Mr Yulin Yuan, the owner of a well-established inspection service in China: \u201cNormally the scammers cannot obtain a real Business License or Export License from local officials, but they can obtain some license samples online in China, then they will use Photoshop or other technics to change the names, business scopes or registered captial etc. They can even 'make' an official Stamp or Chop easily. This is why you can see there are so many scammers online worldwide. The license look exactly the same as the real one, you can hardly check them out without professional knowlege in Chinese. A Business License can tell you whether they are real manufacturer or not in China ( their business scope, registered capital, legal representative, history and address etc. ) Good luck, everybody!\u201d\n\nThere are some sites where verification is thorough and real, but I consider it irresponsible to send people to those safe sites unless I know they have an understanding of safe sourcing practice. From my experience in dealing with many hundreds of newbie importers I know that very few really understand the risks. Many are lucky, but a greater number make costly mistakes.\n\nMost would-be importers still flock to Alibaba for product sourcing, so that site gets the lion\u2019s share of my criticism, but when you read through this post you will see that other sites are just as bad.\n\nIn an earlier post I wrote about a news item \u201cAlibaba and the 2336 thieves\u201d dealing with Gold Supplier scams admitted by Alibaba. Well, the system used by almost every big B2B site is very similar. The purpose of this post is to alert Fastlane members to the fact that there are risks in using the popular sites for sourcing.\n\nRather than rely on the fact that so many people say Alibaba or some other site is great, why not do some checking for yourself?\n\nI will start with Alibaba:  There are many places to look and get the stories from people who won\u2019t recommend Alibaba and I will mention one of them later, but there is no place better than Alibaba itself !\n\nAlibaba have their own very extensive forum. Below is a link to the section of Alibaba\u2019s discussion forums where Alibaba staff and buyers post comments. Please note that some of the posts with various user names are obviously posted by Alibaba employees.\n\nWhen looking for comments from buyers I suggest you scroll down the threads list until you find threads with numerous replies. http://resources.alibaba.com/discussion_board/88/Safe_Trading_Basics.htm\n\nThe thread THREE SIMPLE SIGNS OF B2B SCAMS in the Forum section: \u201cSAFE TRADING BASICS\u201d begins with a much too basic introduction by admin and includes this: \"Just because a company has a professional-looking website or has set up shop in an online marketplace like Alibaba.com doesn't automatically make them legitimate.\"\n\nThen a potential buyer new to Alibaba posted in reply to that point: \u201cAnd Alibaba claims these suppliers have been verified. How do you reconcile this contradiction?\u201d  \n\nLike almost all critical comments posted on the Alibaba forums, this one went unanswered. The reason must be that it is unanswerable. The verification process is clearly intended to make buyers believe that the verified supplier is legitimate.\n\nTradekey also has a community forum at http://community.tradekey.com/forum-88/Report_Suspicious_Companies/0/1320.html There you will find many posts by Tradekey buyers complaining about being scammed by suppliers found on that site. It is necessary to start at Page 133, because the first 132 pages are full of spam. As is the case with Alibaba, Tradekey staff post a lot of replies.\n\nHere is one post from a UK Tradekey user, minus the last two rather offensive paragraphs: \u201dIts a typical situation that tradekey makes money from, GOLD MEMBERS a lot of the gold members pay to get there Gold membership and tradekey does nothing to verifiy the legitimacy of these companies\n1. so eventually a GOLD member scams and makes alot of money from unsuspecting buyers,\n2. buyer complains to trade key \n3. the GOLD member gets shut down\n4. All complaints get logged, BUT THE SELLER IS NEVER FOUND BECAUSE HE/SHE IS USING A FRAUDLENT ADDRESS AND COMPANY DETAILS (tradekey.com fault becasue they fail to check and verifiy if the seller is legitimate) the same seller then PAYS FOR ANOTHER GOLD MEMBER PASS, NEW COMPANY NAMES MADE UP (tradekey.com MAKES MONEY)\n\nEC21.COM has a community forum here: http://community.ec21.com/forum/viewforum.jsp?forum_id=90000006 This is a link to the Report and Verify Fraud forum. Note, EC21\u2019s Gold Supplier equivalent is Trade Pro. Here is one of the posts. Sorry it is all in caps, but the buyer is clearly very upset.\n\n\u201cEC21 DOES NOTHING TO STOP FRAUD - AMITY SAMCO TRADERS FRAUD\n\n\nTHE SELLER THAT RIPPED ME OFF STILL HAS AN ACTIVE PROFILE THAT SAYS TRADE PRO VERIFIED SINCE 2014.   THESE SCAMMERS HAVE THE ENDORSEMENT OF EC21.  EC21 HAS DONE NOTHING ABOUT THIS FRAUD EXCEPT TO CONTINUE TO LET AMITY SAMCO TRADERS KEEP A PROFILE UP WITH THEIR ENDORSEMENT,   THIS IS TOTAL BULLSHIT.  YOU CANNOT RELY ON EC21 TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT FRAUD.\u201d\n\n\nMost B2B sites don't have a community forum, but with little effort you can find comments posted online by buyers unhappy with the sloppy verification process used by most B2B sites. \n\nhttp://alibabascam.com/  As of today\u2019s date there are 738 denunciations of Alibaba suppliers on this site. If you go to the site tomorrow you will find more complaints added. Many of the suppliers mentioned are Gold Suppliers.\n\nhttp://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/www.dhgate.com This site has recorded 1483 reports on dhgate and they rate 2.9.

There is also a \"Merchandise Processing Fee\" to add to that, and that fee is not usually quoted in advance.\n\nOne of the the biggest problems I see is the very thing you could not make sense of: Definitions. The two best ways around this are:\n1. Get a ruling from USCBP in advance of placing an order. Those written rulings are like money in your pocket if the ruling favors you. No matter what the USCBP officer assessing your shipment had for breakfast that day, that ruling stands. (Even if it was actually incorrect!)\n2. Get advice from a licensed customs broker. This will not have the standing of a USCBP ruling, but it could save you going to a lot of trouble and finding that your research has led you to believe that a product has a certain HS code or tariff rate etc., but the assessing officer thinks otherwise. Unless it is big money involved you don't want to try to dispute their decision.\n\nI am not a licensed customs broker and for years I have preferred to pay one to do the donkey work for me, so don't rely on my assessment. I know how it all works, but the rules and regulations, including definitions are continually changing. That is why paid advice is worth it in my opinion. I prefer to spend my time doing more rewarding things.\n\nYour reference to items from some countries being duty free is no longer applicable. The Generalized System Of Preferences (GSP) expired in July last year in the US, and now MFN rates apply. This is a good example of the constant changes taking place and the need to keep up to date. I generally don't and if I was still importing I would not bother because it is so time consuming. I would pay a broker.\n\nWalter", "Q. 11\n\nQ. Do I have to register a business and provide a Tax ID in order to import.\n\nA. The short answer is: NO, but read on, because I add a very valuable hint further down.\n\nIn almost every country, when you first import anything commercially, if the value is sufficient to have to pay Duty and/or Sales Tax, you will be issued with an importer number. It goes by different names in different countries, but it is an identifying number that allows Customs authorities to keep track of what you import, when, and the values.\n\nIt also makes it faster to lodge customs clearance documentation in future.\n\nIf your first import is handled by an air courier or a freight forwarder, they will automatically obtain an importer\u2019s number for you. It is worth asking them to tell you that number for future reference. They will not volunteer it.\n\nIf an importer later registers a business and imports under that name rather than his own name, a new importer number will be issued. There is no requirement for the importer to cancel the old number.\n\nThis last fact is worth remembering should you ever make a mistake and foul your reputation with Customs. You can change your business name and address, and then your old importer\u2019s number will not be matched to your subsequent imports. In effect you will have a clean slate.\n\nTOPIC HEADINGS PREVIOUSLY POSTED IN THIS THREAD:\n\u25a0 Introduction.

There is not. China is trying to improve their image in this area, but getting through to the millions of businesses in China is a difficult task for the authorities. They do prosecute \"flagship\" cases, but the Chinese media has much more interesting things to put before the public, so education is a slow process.\n\nCase History: One of my former franchisees placed a very large order for items bearing the logo and trademark of a very big organization, with their authority to do so. He gave strict instructions that no images of the product were to be displayed in advertising. An associated company closely affiliated with the supplier breached that agreement. Fortunately the goodwill from longstanding association was sufficient to have the advertising withdrawn.\n\nAs this case shows, the importance of building a good relationship cannot be over-emphasized. The client organization had the financial power to destroy my franchisee\u2019s business, or possibly help him pursue the case in a Chinese court, but just consider how preferable it is to be able to contact a senior executive on a personal level, explain what had happened, and get an immediate, cost free, and trouble free resolution.\n\nBuild that relationship!

Relationships are way above all other cultural things you need to know about.\n\nAs a seller, not a buyer, in my first visit to consolidate and hopefully build upon the relationship that I had been developing by phone and fax, (before the days of the Internet), I expected to entertain my prospective agent. Not so. I was collected from the airport by the MD, taken to my hotel, and after allowing me time to settle in he arrived back to take me to dinner.\n\nAll the executives in his team were there, together with an interpreter. I had not until then realized that as a seller I was expected to communicate through an interpreter. To save face for me, they provided one!\n\nThe meal was a banquet of staggering proportions, and lasted for nearly 3 hours. There was no discussion about business. I did not raise the subject because my cultural research had at least taught me that I should not do that. Business was not raised until after they had taken me to lunch the next day. Only a 2 hour meal session this time.\n\nWhat I learned was that they regarded me as a person of value to their business, even though I was the seller and wanted them to be my agents. They set out to prove to me that they were good people to do business with. As it turned out they were, and they proved to be excellent agents for my products right up to the time that I sold my export manufacturing business.\n\nYou can learn as you go, a lot of other things such as ceremonial exchange of greeting cards, the significance of colors etc., but a friendly approach, refraining from being pushy, and exchanging greetings where appropriate should be lesson #1.\n\nAs a matter of interest, the Chinese communications giant Huawei, has chosen a name that is a universal greeting in China. Some Chinese businesses do answer the phone in English, but if you call and you are expecting an English speaking person to answer, don't be put off when instead of \"Hello\" you hear what sounds like \"Hwayyy\". It is a friendly greeting. Your answer before you speak in English should be: \"Hwayyy.\"", "LinorCG said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nJust wanted to chime in, I really believe that most businesses do place a good deal on relationship and trust, as they know its really an effort to get a good client/customer and manufacturer/supplier now a days.\n\nOne of the potential manufacturer/supplier I have actually sent me a card (message written personally) in the samples that they sent.

I would like to add a couple of comments:\n\nThere are cultural differences in English speaking countries, and I have found in 2 of them that relationship building has a very low priority, evident in the poor customer service. I exploited this when setting up my franchise network in those countries. Obliging my franchisees to give old fashioned, friendly personal service contributed to seeing them rapidly build market share. In the other 2 countries where I franchised my business, other things appealed more, but that is part of a marketing story that I may write about one day.\n\nTrust. This point that you raised is of such great importance that I wanted  to expand on it. While it is true that the Chinese businessmen are trying to win your business, what I wrote in my reply to miked-d is relevant. Those men feasting me were also building up trust. Our mutual respect grew as time went by so that they and I knew that a handshake was at least as good as a signed agreement.\n\nSubstantial orders were made by them and delivered by me over a period of nine years without any signed contract. On occasion I delivered a shipment that was only part paid for in advance, but the money was forthcoming. Some might say I was foolish, but trust and mutual respect works exceptionally well in dealing with Chinese businesses. So much so that demanding a signed agreement or some other formality could sometimes be detrimental to business. \n\nI extended this approach to trust in relationships so effectively that I was able to obtain a monthly account with most suppliers when I was running my importing business. My franchisees all enjoyed the same privilege, based solely on me vouching for them. No credit references needed! I have had seasoned importers ridicule me, saying that monthly accounts are impossible, but if you develop a great relationship with trust as a major factor, it can be done.", "Walter Hay said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nSome might say I was foolish, but trust and mutual respect works exceptionally well in dealing with Chinese businesses.

Most of my imports have been small, high value items, and they all came by air courier or EMS. I did ship one large consignment of bulky  items by air freight, using a freight forwarder. He got me a commodity rate that was not a lot more than sea freight, because what I shipped was well under half an LCL quantity, and LCL rates for smaller consignments are usually quite high. I would advise consulting a freight forwarder and checking out all options with him. Do so well in advance of placing an order for the goods, and get the quote in writing. The quote should be door to door, including the customs clearance work.\n2. Ignore the Gold Supplier part of the supplier's credentials. Check the TUV verification. It is probably only there under the \"Onsite Verification\" criterion, in which case it tells you nothing other than the fact that the business actually exists. If you really must use Alibaba, try looking for suppliers that are Assessed Suppliers (Red Tick in Blue Circle), but not Onsite Checked suppliers. You will still have to carefully read the Audit Report. Being willing to accept escrow is a good sign, but be sure to read my earlier post about Alibaba escrow rules.\n3.

I have received a parcel from a supplier I found on dhgate and it contains nothing but scrap paper! I had to sign for it before I could open it to check it, so Dhgate say it has been received and they will release payment within 2 days. The rules for disputes are too @#!!X*! complicated and they seem to be changing them when they reply to my complaint because I can\u2019t find the rules they quote on the website. What can I do? This cost me $130.\n\nA. You have seen in my forum posts that I would never recommend DHgate because of the huge number of scams reported, but I am happy to help for your future buying. There are many possible problems with the so-called protection provided by escrow services controlled by the big B2B sites, and you have been caught out by one of them. Because DHgate have told you that because you signed for the parcel, payment will be released to the seller, they will also ask you for proof that the package only contained paper, but any bunny would know that a photo is useless as proof. They will tell you to return the parcel to the supplier, but the supplier will either say they did not receive it, or that it had the goods inside when they sent it.DH gate are only going through the motions until you give up.\n\nIf you paid through PayPal, lodge a dispute with them, but do not say that the goods are not as described, otherwise PayPal will reject your dispute. Tell them that this is a fraud and you signed for an empty package. Depending on which country you are in, contact any government fraud watch body and report this fraud, asking them to contact PayPal and DHgate.com on your behalf. This method has worked for others.\n\nIn future, ask the courier to wait while you open the package. If he/she is a reasonable person they will allow this and you can then refuse to sign for it if it contains paper or other filling instead of the product. I have known people to receive stones, and in one case a brick.\n\nFor the benefit of other readers, I add that you should save a screen shot of the page where you found the product listing, as well as keeping copies of all emails, whether through your own email account or your member\u2019s email on the B2B site. Do this progressively from the beginning of your earliest negotiations to buy, right through to receiving notice of shipment. Save every email even after that point. A number of people report finding all their member emails deleted and that makes it impossible to pursue a dispute claim.\n\nRemember that in almost every case you will be required to return the goods in order to have your claim processed. It is common for suppliers to not take delivery of your parcel, and so they can say you did not return it. That will be another loss to add to what you have already paid.\n\nMake sure you have read the escrow rules, if you can find them. Copy them also.\n\nSOLUTION: In future ask the supplier to accept payment through a reliable service such as escrow.com, telling them you will pay the escrow fees. If they refuse, look for a supplier you can trust, because if they refuse, it could be because they are not trustworthy. You may have to look on websites other than the one where you usually source products.\n\nYou can offer some evidence regarding escrow.com\u2019s high standing:\nIn the US Government\u2019s Strategic Partners List, escrow.com are listed first: http://export.gov/CSPartners/eg_main_051038.asp\neBay will only allow the use of escrow services provided by escrow.com see: http://pages.ebay.com/help/pay/escrow.html\nLicensing of escrow.com by government authorities can be found here: https://www.escrow.com/escrow-101/escrow-licenses.aspx", "Wondering if this is shady or the normal way things work in China.. \nI'm trying to order samples from a company and I've been talking with their sales representative.

I did it successfully because I manufactured my own products, I knew the market on a worldwide basis, and I had been involved in the shipping industry since I got my first job after college.\n\nThat does not mean you can't do it. You have some distinct advantages, in particular an understanding of the local language where you will source supplies, and a wife with highly appropriate experience.\n\n\nYou need to know the product and the market. That is where your wife can help. As a department store manager she would be able to tell you which manufacturers give good reliable service, and have products that would be desirable in your target market.   \n\nYou will need to learn shipping terminology, in particular Incoterms. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incoterms  There are other terms that you will have to learn such as Letter of Credit and Bill of Lading.\n\nYour biggest problem will be finding buyers. One way you can do that is register as a seller on Alibaba (I know I knock Alibaba, but that is for buyers. It is great for sellers.) You may have to pay their $699 fee to become a Gold Supplier. That is the current discounted rate on offer for the \"Lite\" version.There are other places where you can advertise for free, but that must be done in a manner that I will explain to you privately. Let me know when you are in need of that information.\n\nYour next biggest problem will be to establish good relationships with the manufacturers while acting as a a middleman, which they generally won't like.\nYou will have to be prepared to carry a small sample inventory to be able to ship to buyers wanting to check out the quality. For this you will have to negotiate very low rates with air couriers. Don't agree to pay any more than 50% of their schedule rates, but even lower prices are common. Cultivate an association with a good freight forwarder for larger shipments.\n\nCheck the garment sizing and make sure the manufacturer knows you are buying for women in western countries.\nThe Seoul Global Business Center will be able to help you with the business set up side of things, but probably won't be able to help much with other aspects of the business. I suggest you visit the World Trade Center which is quite close to the Seoul Global Business Center. They are more export-oriented and should be of much more help.\n\nTOPIC HEADINGS PREVIOUSLY POSTED IN THIS THREAD:\n\u25a0 Introduction.

Even some of the developed countries are now very competitive.\n\nLet me know if I can help with your importing venture.", "How to Find Unique Products\n\nFirst a little preamble.\n\nCompetition is all well and good. Yes it does stimulate the market, but good marketers can stimulate without competition.\n\nWhen running my own businesses I loved having no competition. How did I achieve that?\n\nI  built a better mousetrap. I saw that in a particular industrial application that I was very familiar with, the product almost universally used had some very undesirable characteristics. Simply put, it had once been the best thing since sliced bread, but I knew that I could substantially improve on it. I did just that \u2015 then I sold it like crazy, charging nearly double what the old product sold at. I achieved 100% market share in my own country, then built an export market. I did not even discount the product for my agents, because the product was so good!\n\nI found a USP that worked wonders. I was now importing and selling B2B. My biggest local competitor had a 90% market share in the market sector that was the most lucrative. The USP was the word FREE. The complacent competitor charged huge set up fees. I offered FREE set up. It was as simple as that. Like a frog in a pan of water slowly coming to the boil and not noticing the increasing heat, he did not realize what was happening until I had consolidated my grip on the market, and I had 90% of that market. He sold his greatly devalued business to a small competitor, but they never became a threat. I franchised the business interstate and repeated the process, then took my franchise system overseas to 3 more countries where I was able to do exactly the same.\nNow .... the easiest way I know how to find unique products. When people think of product sourcing the vast majority think of China. That is where everyone buys cheap isn't it? Yes, and most buy the same products as hundreds of competitors because they are all looking for suppliers of those hot sellers that they have researched on eBay, Amazon etc.\n\nThe easiest way that I have found is to source from countries other than China. Too difficult? Yes it is a little harder than sourcing from China, but those who do it are moving into the fastlane quicker than most new importers. \n\nPrices are too high? You might pay more for a product than you think you would pay in China, but China does not make such products. They may make jewelry by the ton but they don't make the classy designs that you can buy in other countries. They may make cheap shoes but they don't have the marketability of \"Made in Italy.\"\n\nThose wedded to Alibaba or China in general will find a lot more excuses to not consider other countries, but I know that a lot of my students have done very well by sourcing outside China.", "Walter, just wanted to thank you for the book. I got it with the PAC, and found it to be an absolute goldmine.", "Q & A 13.  This was a double barreled question, so I have set it out in 2 parts.\n\nQ. 13 (a) Hello,I was wondering if I might ask you a quick question. Just reading around on the web I found this \"The amount of money you save going through the factory is generally quite small. You might only save between 5-10% or worse, you might save none because the trading company is able to negotiate such low discounts that they can give you an even lower price than if you went directly through the factory.\"\n\nAnd wanted to ask what your thoughts were on it? Thank you again,\n\nA. 13 (a) That article is obviously written by a trader, a sourcing agent, or someone who has not had a lot of real experience. The usual difference in price between a trader's price and a manufacturer's price is around 50%. Just like wholesalers, the trader will usually mark up by 100%.\n\nContrary to what most people think, discounts for increasing the size of an order are usually quite small. Any big discounts offered by a trader are usually a result of a trader buying a discontinued line or faulty product.\n\nYou will do much better by buying direct from the manufacturer.\n\nQ. 13 (b) Also, do you know what the Chinese manufacturers mark up their products at on average? Seems like we as retailers try to have a 100% mark up, this seems to cover most fees and bills to be comfortable.... do you think the manufacturers have the same number in their mind too?\n\nA. 13 (b) One of my long time Chinese business associates tells me that the average mark up by manufacturers is hard to estimate, but is probably only around 30%. He adds that in some cases he has known it to be a lot higher; as much as 350%. The lower margin would usually apply to products that are very common, but if the manufacturer has a unique product he knows he can charge a lot higher prices without fear of competition. He tells me his mark up is only 30%, but I would not expect him to tell me it is higher even if it is, but I have no reason to doubt his estimate on the average being 30%.\n\nThose manufacturers working on a low markup obviously will not be able to offer substantial discounts if they are in a competitive field and consequently start off with a quote that is close to the selling price they really want.", "TopChef said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nJust wanted to thank Walter for helping me out with a roadblock I was having.\n\nI am trying to source a specific product from China and I was always getting stuck with the same problem.

Strictly from a business perspective, I would choose South Korea, mainly because that will give you personal access to manufacturers of products that are less likely to be found by the average importer in the UK, USA, etc. That can give you a competitive edge. I would also prefer to live in South Korea than in China.\n\nIn answer to your specific questions:\n\n1. I would look to set up a retail business in the UK or the USA selling on eBay and/or Amazon. For selling on Amazon you could use the FBA system, and you would have the advantage of being able to be the shipper, so your suppliers would not learn about you selling on Amazon.\n\nYou can also use FBA to sell on eBay, but if you are only using FBA as a fulfillment service you might consider using an alternative, lower cost service. It is worth remembering that Amazon have a tendency to compete with their own customers and they could find the same products and cut you out of the market.\n\nI suggest you plan ahead by talking to family members who may be willing and able to act on your behalf in the UK. Not only receiving goods but possibly fulfilling orders?\n\n2. I would register in the UK, but later on there may be benefits in having a company registered in South Korea or Hong Kong. Even if you don't use it, cost and red tape may be worth it as a back up.\n\n3.

Some were worried that without a sourcing agent they were taking too big a risk.\n\nOne even referred me to a girl in China who offers to find the best manufacturers for you for $15!!!\n\nQ. Do You Really Need A Sourcing Agent? \n\nA. There has recently been a considerable increase in the number of Chinese businesses offering their services as sourcing agents. I have seen numerous posts on two other business forums, as well as two on this forum in which businesses who sell their sourcing services are openly promoting their services, some via blogs.\n\nOn one of those other forums the poster aggressively attacked me for telling my book readers that they do not need the services of a sourcing agent, and a forum member saw that post and PM\u2019d me with this question.\n\nFirst let me differentiate between a sourcing agent and an inspection service.\n\nSourcing agents offer to locate for you the best suppliers, whether manufacturers or traders. They claim to have the benefit of local knowledge that is not possible for outsiders. Well, I have spent so much time in China since my first visit in 1978 that I don\u2019t feel like an outsider. I remain on friendly terms with, and still regularly communicate with, two of my long time Chinese business associates. I believe I am well qualified to comment on the merits of using a sourcing agent.\n\nInspection services should not be confused with sourcing agent services. I know that most sourcing agents also offer to do inspections, but inspections are a very specialized activity, and I would not rely on someone who does not have a provable track record like the big inspection services I have previously listed in this thread.\n\nIn their push for business, many sourcing agents use scare tactics, claiming that by trying to source and import without their help you are leaving yourself open to scams, shoddy products, paying too much, shipping problems, and customs problems.\n\nRecently I have read posts in which one sourcing agent claimed that there is no such thing as a safe sourcing site and on another forum where one says there is no such thing as safe sourcing at all! If either or both of these claims be true, I would not have hundreds of people successfully using my book to guide them in safe sourcing.\n\nOut of the hundreds of people using my book only one has reported being scammed, and that was because he broke three of my most important rules: a) He sourced through Alibaba, b) He placed a large initial order, c) He paid through Western Union. Fortunately he admits that he should have taken my advice.\n\nPrior to retirement, I taught a large number of franchisees to source in the same way as I teach in my book. Not a single one was ever scammed, and as far as buying at best prices is concerned; with an average of only a few orders every day, (sometimes 8 or 10,) they enjoyed a quiet life and a big income. At least one of them surfed every day! They all made 6 figure profits. Only a few of them ever visited China or any of the other countries where we sourced products.\n\nSo the answer is that in my experience, having been an importer since 1987 and never having used a sourcing agent, no, you don\u2019t need such a service, provided you understand safe sourcing and use safe sites. Both do exist.", "Hey Walter,\n\nNot sure if you mentioned it or not...but do you have any recommended websites or contacts to source manufacturers in Europe and possibly the U.S..?\n\nThanks!", "ddzc said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nHey Walter,\n\nNot sure if you mentioned it or not...but do you have any recommended websites or contacts to source manufacturers in Europe and possibly the U.S..?\n\nThanks!Click to expand...\n\nSorry to tell you this, and I know it won't go down well with a lot of members of the forum, but I don't publish them online.\n\nI have about 20 sites listed in my book and I encourage people to source in places other than China, but just having a site name is only part of the story.

Don't forget, if you found them on Alibaba, it is almost certain that they are traders. Traders and wholesalers tend to be inflexible on MOQs. The reason I am sure you are dealing with a trader not a manufacturer is that traders and even wholesalers rarely carry inventory, whereas manufacturers always have production overruns on hand. They often make the overrun quite large so that they have a good supply of sample.\n\nI do find it strange that they quote an MOQ of 5 pcs.\n\nI think what might have happened is that their advertisement on Alibaba shows the lowest price for a maximum order quantity, not an MOQ. In order to get you to at least make first contact they also refer to an MOQ of 5 pcs.\n\nBut when you refer to MOQ, I think you are doing what I have seen many newbies do, and that is to think that MOQ means the minimum that you want to order. In fact MOQ means the minimum order quantity that the supplier is willing to accept an order for. If they ask you how many you want to order, that is not referring to an MOQ.\n\nMOQ is for suppliers not buyers.\n\nSo, let's put it another way .......\n\nIf they publish an MOQ of 5 pcs, that is the minimum they will accept an order for.\nIf they ask you how many do you want to order, that can be a tricky question to answer. It is best to tell them that you want to order a trial quantity of 5 pcs (in this case) so that you can check the product.\n\nRather than ask them for 5 samples, ask them for a trial order of 5pcs. It means the same thing but will be more acceptable to the supplier.", "Extremely sorry.. I meant an MOQ of 500 pieces.. big typo there.. so they quoted 9$ for an MOQ of 500 pieces.

It is commonplace for certificates to be forged. Also, even if they are genuine they will often be out of date.\n\nMost of the authoritative certification companies will have a place on their website where you can insert the certificate number for checking. Because almost every business in China trades under several different names you may find the name on the certificate does not match the name of the company you are dealing with. That is not a concern provided you can confirm that it is the same business, just a different name.", "So much helpful info!

What do you think of that new feature on Alibaba \"Trade Assurance\"?\n\n\nOrder quality and on-time shipment safeguards\n100% payment refund up to Trade Assurance Amount\nClick to expand...\n\nJust like the situation with Alibaba's escrow system, the rules, including the terms and conditions, are very complex, and contain some contradictions.\n\nYou need to read them all several times to be sure you have not missed important points. For example, you are required to pay for a quality inspection prior to shipment. The inspection services that Alibaba allow are 3 of the biggest and oldest such businesses, and I would certainly rely on their judgement. \n\nThere are two potential problems with this arrangement. 1. Cost. A shipment quality inspection can cost from $250 for a very minimal inspection up to $1,000, maybe more, for a very thorough inspection that may involve assembly of several random samples taken from the shipment, and disassembling them and repacking. It is refunded if the quality fails inspection. 2. Specifications must be incorporated in your purchase order (Alibaba correctly call it a contract) and only the exact matters addressed in your specifications will be subject to inspection.\n\nA significant contradiction relates to the requirement for inspections. In Terms and Conditions 3 it states \"....(you need to raise any product quality claims before the products are shipped out, which means you will need to arrange for the products to be inspected before they are shipped out) \" but in 5 it is implied that an inspection must be carried out after the buyer has been unable to get a satisfactory response from the supplier. In FAQs Quality 1, it states \"We recommend you strictly control the quality of the goods before shipment, if the order quality can\u2019t meet the quality requirements before shipment, you can submit a claim.\"\n\nIf you only read the rules and don't bother with the Terms and Conditions, or the FAQs you will not find any reference to the requirement to have an inspection done prior to shipment.\n\nIt is worth noting that if the buyer and the seller have agreed to declare a lower that true value for Customs, the buyer cannot make a successful claim. Also, no claim can succeed if the buyer arranges freight!!! In other words no FOB or EXW orders will be covered.\n\nI have not dealt with claims for late shipment, but I think what I have outlined above should suffice to show that the Trade Assurance protection appears to be a very tricky area. For example it is claimed that you will receive a 100% refund, but in reality, as is the case with escrow claims, you will be pushed to accept a partial refund.", "Micha\u0142 K\u00f3ska said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\n1.Do you look for occasions while purchasing or you do buy stuff you know you will sell right away?\n2.Any advice to a person in Poland who would like to start importing/ selling globally?\nCheers!Click to expand...\n\nHi Michal,\n\nI do not do any online marketing of physical products.

This is really useful information.", "Q & A 15 My answer contains a serious warning with implications for all who sell on Amazon. Lately this question comes up more and more as sellers join up to Fulfillment By Amazon\n\nQ. Can I ship direct from my supplier in China straight to Amazon FBA?\n\nA. The very short answer is yes, but \u2026\u2026 Is it a good idea? Chinese suppliers have swamped eBay in both the US and the UK, and to a lesser extent Australia. Many of them ship orders from China but more of them ship from HK. The really keen ones are shipping inventory to a front man in the US, UK, or Australia, and offering rapid local delivery. There is no reason why they can\u2019t do the same using FBA. In fact it is easier for them because in effect, Amazon becomes their front man.\n\nIf you get your supplier to ship direct to FBA you are introducing them to a marketing medium that they have possibly never heard of, and so far, very few appear to be using.\n\nI have seen a small number of Chinese manufacturers and traders set up branch operations in Western countries. There are major costs involved for them in doing that, and consequently that inhibits them to a large extent, but with FBA, the costs are negligible, and it opens up the retail market for them.\n\nThe major advantage held by locals who have often been able to charge higher prices by virtue of being local and giving faster delivery will disappear.\n\nIs there an answer? The best I can suggest is that if you use Amazon Prime all you do is ship to a prepping service who can do the checking and other preparation for you before shipping to FBA, or if you don\u2019t use Prime you can use an independent fulfilment service.\n\nTOPIC HEADINGS PREVIOUSLY POSTED IN THIS THREAD:\n\u25a0 Introduction.

Local suppliers might be drawn to deal with you in order to get the benefit of the government favored contracts.  Although I am not a fan of dropshipping, such a model might work in this case. Letting local suppliers know about your existence would be the hard part. It is not easy to bring appropriate traffic to your website, and a member more expert in that field might have some suggestions. \n\nOther advertising might be more effective, even direct mail to US manufacturers. I Have had huge success with direct mail in B2B selling so I could offer some private help (no charge) if you go down that track. I would suggest specializing in a limited range of product types. You can find US manufacturers on thomasnet.com.\n\n2. Overseas suppliers are unlikely to have the same understanding, and I would just research suppliers for those product areas that interest you and be ready to get their quotes when contracts come up. You would need to do trial runs to be confident that your suppliers can meet the requirements. I recommend that you avoid the traders that have swamped Alibaba and some other big B2B sites pretending to be manufacturers. Think about the freight cost and look for products that are light and small.\n\nBest wishes,\nWalter", "Success Story.\n\nOne success story that I find very interesting is from a person who bought my book and did not have great ambitions. He wanted to get more profit out of the products that he was selling at fleamarkets, so he decided to import them direct from the manufacturer.\n\nOther stall holders chatted with him and were amazed at the fact that he could buy direct, so they asked him if he could supply them at wholesale prices. He imported some products to suit those stall holders and before long he was making more money as a wholesaler than he had ever done with his market stall, so he gave up selling at the flea markets.\n\nOne of his USPs is that he can supply products that are not stocked by other wholesalers, and he has a policy of only supplying any particular product to no more than two stall holders in one town. That allows the stall holders to sell more profitably. In cities he varies that rule because there are often numerous markets there. It is rare to find importing wholesalers who will act as ethically as that. \n\nAnother USP is that he imports to order. He can do that profitably because he now knows how to get suppliers to agree to small orders. A big benefit to him from this is that he learns of products that he might not have otherwise thought of, and he can sell them to other stallholders who are not selling in places anywhere near where the originator of the request operates.\n\nHe travels extensively; visiting flea markets all over the country and now has a thriving wholesale business. Business has grown to the point that he has appointed commission reps for some areas, because he can\u2019t possibly visit every place where there are potential customers.\n\nThe interesting thing about his success story is that his success was opportunistic and not a result of a carefully thought out plan, but he saw the opportunity and grabbed it with both hands.", "Hey Walter,\n\nAny suggestions on how to go about finding local US suppliers?

Inspection services in China are multiplying rapidly and it is common on some business forums to see numerous Chinese individuals jumping on the bandwagon and offering their services.\n\nThe big question is how well do they do their job, how reliable are they and are they ethical? I will answer your questions first.\n\n1. I find it disappointing that Alibaba's listing of inspection services contains obsolete information. I checked out 4 of the services quite extensively, and found that none have transactions listed later than Sept 2013. This begs the question whether the quality of the services listed has been maintained or has it dropped off?\n\nAlso, the charges shown are mostly obsolete. In fact the rates for the ones I checked had risen substantially above the rates show on Alibaba's list. For example, Richforth now charge $180 per man day not $103 as listed. \n\nIt is also interesting to note that on Richforth's own site they display a price of $180 on their home page, but still show $103 on some other pages that are clearly well out of date. You are right about inspectgoods.com being owned by Richforth. \n\nThey only display one testimonial on their site and being a suspicious person I doubt that it is genuine. I have contacted a friend in Taiwan where the testimonial supposedly originates and will let you know what he reports.\n\n2. I would see the fact that Richforth are traders as a possible red flag, but only if they offer product sourcing for you. It only suggests that either the inspection service or the trading is a sideline.\n\n3. Inspection services in China are completely uncontrolled. Some of the services listed by Alibaba quote membership of bodies that I have never heard of. The whole system relies entirely on trust. Knowing that there is no verification process whatsoever, and that Alibaba will list for a fee any person claiming to be an inspection service does not instil trust.\n\nOne of the inspections services listed quotes a rate much higher than that charged by the century old European services, but in the list of reviews the amount charged in each case is shown as $0. Another service listed shows a charge of $253 for a supplier verification!\n\nSumming up, I would suggest you be absolutely sure what you are paying for before you employ any of the services listed. It would probably pay to also get a quote from one of the services I have previously mentioned. I think it is significant that Alibaba's rules relating escrow claims specify that you must have an inspection done by one of the 3 big European Inspection services.

They specify that those inspections can only be carried out by one of the 3 big European inspection services. See my post on the subject on Page 11.\n\nTo qualify for protection under their new scheme they do not appear to allow the use of any of the inspection services on their list of advertisers. That is not a good recommendation, if Alibaba themselves won't rely on them.", "Q & A 16.  This question is about visiting Yiwu markets but I have included in my answer some comments about using the Yiwu Markets B2B site.\n\nQ. I have heard that Yiwu markets are a good place to buy. Is it worth a visit?\nA. Yiwu is a permanent market rather like an oriental bazaar, where thousands of businesses rent stalls. Some are there permanently and some are only short term. A very large number of them do not speak English and this means you need to pay an interpreter.\n\nThat puts you at a great disadvantage because you don't know how accurately the translator is telling the stallholder what you said or telling you what the stallholder said. You won't know if they have arranged a commission for introducing you to the seller or for telling you that this stallholder has offered the best price.\n\nThe interpreter might only translate properly at those places where he/she gets a commission. Also, many of the exhibitors are traders, and that means you can\u2019t get ex-factory prices.\n\nThe Yiwu market is vast, covering over 2,000 acres and you would need several days to even scratch the surface.\n\nA major consideration is that Yiwu stallholders are notorious for selling rejects and generally poor quality. Some dollar store owners visit regularly and they don\u2019t care much about quality or continuity of supply. If you want to establish a reputation or your own brand, Yiwu is definitely not the place to buy.\n\nIf you want quick profits and don\u2019t care too much about your reputation, you don\u2019t have to visit China in order to buy at Yiwu. You can buy from the suppliers at Yiwu by using the Yiwu market website, operated by CCC Group, but there are a few reasons why I would not consider that.\n\nFirstly, if you buy good quality products, (and they do exist there), you will certainly pay more than you would if you bought direct from the manufacturers. CCC are acting as brokers and they add a margin, which obviously reduces your profits.\n\nSecondly, because many stallholders have no English, problems can arise in relation to descriptions, specifications, packaging, etc. CCC say they handle that for you, but with thousands of small transactions taking place daily, chances are that such problems will not receive much attention.\n\nThirdly, product illustrations are not good and it can be a bit of a lottery as to whether the real product will look the way you expect it to.\n\nIf you have the time and money to visit China, I would recommend doing so, but you must do your homework first.

Possibly this is because a lot of newbies consider paying $300 to join Worldwide Brands so that they can start a dropship business.\n\nI have had numerous people succeed at this, although as I wrote in a recent post on another thread, that is a slowlane project. Here is how I see it working and it involves my adaptation of big business's Just In Time system.\n\nThe small entrepreneur can use my \"just in time\" ordering system which works better than dropshipping and gives massively better profits.\n.\nThis is how it works:\n1. You buy a small inventory from China or another overseas country and start selling.\n2. You have happy customers because you can dispatch the same day.\n3. Once you are certain you are on a winner you place another order and it is delivered door to door for you via air courier.\n4. The huge profit margins include the cost of the air courier.\n5. You can increase inventory size or product range using some of the profits.\n\nThe key to this system is finding real manufacturers, not the thousands of them posing as manufacturers on popular B2B sourcing portals. In reality they are traders, wholesalers, or resellers who would eat into your profits if you fall for it.\n\nToday I received an email from one such newbie. Here it is without comment from me:\n\n\"Ok. From extremely skeptical to successful completion. Credit given where credit is due. I followed the book instructions you laid out.

That is certainly the case with electronics. A visit to their factory will usually give a better result, because they will take you more seriously, but if they don't have good QC systems even that is a lost cause.\n\nPersistence can mean costly delays, but it is probably the only way you will find the supplier you want.", "Hot Selling Products\n\nIt is important to understand that just because you get the best possible price from a genuine manufacturer there is no guarantee that you will automatically be able to sell the product profitably.  You may still not be competitive when selling on places like eBay and Amazon. The problem may not be on the supply end, but on the sales end.\n\nThere are many factors that must be considered, and it is most important to do your market research before you start sourcing a product.\n\nI appreciate that market research can be time consuming. Occasionally you might find a product that is a good seller, but when you get quotes from manufacturers the prices turn out to be too high to allow a reasonable margin, let alone a high margin.\n\nThis can be frustrating, but it is almost impossible to predict, except for the fact that if a hot selling product is selling at what is clearly a very low price, chances are you will not locate a manufacturer who will supply at a low enough price to make you competitive.\n\nThe main reason is that hot sellers are often the subject of price wars simply because of their popularity attracting too many sellers. This often begins a race to the bottom, and vendors finish up selling for somewhere around cost, or even lower.\n\nThere is nothing to do in such cases except look for another product and start again. This is why I would avoid hot selling products. Some eBay gurus recommend choosing such products, but you will almost invariably come up against the problem of price wars.\n\nIf a hot seller is one that is being sourced from dropship suppliers, you can almost certainly find a manufacturer who will supply you at a better price than all those vendors are paying from the dropshipper, but remember that you will still be up against a huge number of vendors many of whom will even be willing to sell at their cost or less, to maintain their rankings.\n\nUnless the manufacturer\u2019s price after all costs added leaves you with a margin that allows you to still do well after competing with those people, you should look for another product. Those costs must include all of the costs of buying and landing the product at your door/warehouse/fulfillment house etc. Those are you cost of acquisition. You also have cost of selling, and that can include packaging, postage, eBay fees, Amazon fees, fulfillment fees, PayPal fees etc. etc., ad nauseum.\n\nThere are also many unskilled newbies who beginning selling on places such as eBay without doing all their homework, and they sell at low prices without taking all costs into account. The result is that their very low prices are losing them money, but it also means that sensible sellers will find it almost impossible to compete.\n\nI would go even further and say that if a product is a \"Hot Seller\", you are probably wasting your time and you would be better off looking for a product that is in far less demand, and preferably not even on the market in your country. I have written in earlier posts about finding unique products in countries other than China.\n\nOccasionally I am asked to recommend suppliers. I am generally reluctant to do so, but when I do, it is usually from my experience with that supplier, so the product categories are obviously limited. I also make it a practice to only recommend that supplier to one person. As a result I am running out of suppliers to recommend.\n\nThis is for the same reason that I don't sell lists of manufacturers. It would be so easy  to compile lists for various product categories. People who buy lists are seriously hampering their prospects of success.", "How would you decide which products to import?

(I like headings)\n\nI have strong opinions on this very important subject. The whole internet marketing world seems to be full of copycats. I regard this as a manifestation of laziness and lack of courage. For budding millionaires on the Fastlane forum that seems highly inappropriate. \n\nThat does not mean that it is inappropriate to join an industry that has a successful business model, but first it is important to be sure that the model really is successful. One of the most popular business models in the online selling of physical products is in my opinion not successful. I refer to dropshipping.\n\nI know there are people who make a good living out of reselling products obtained from dropship wholesalers, but the really successful people in that area are the wholesalers, not the resellers. The industry is littered with unhappy failures, and I am planning on writing a critique of dropshipping at some stage.\n\nAs for importing and selling via Amazon FBA, that can be very successful, but without a doubt those who do best at it are the ones doing private labeling. Unfortunately though, there are many copycats in that area too, with supplements being the flavour of the month. A private label does little to maintain profitability if the only difference between you and your competitors is the brand name, and there are hundreds of competitors.\n\nI left a comment in Vigilante\u2019s insider thread and I hope he does not mind me disclosing what I said. It was that I found a diamond among all his gold, and that gem was Vigilante\u2019s practice in looking for products that have not already been sold on the US market.\n\nYou are quite right in thinking that reluctance to reveal import project details exposes the major pitfall of importing. As you say \u201cIf you can get your hands on it, someone else can too.\u201d And indeed they do, so the importers who have been importing and selling run of the mill products like everyone else just find themselves on a product selection and sourcing treadmill.\n\nI have previously written about sourcing unique products in countries other than China and the pitfalls of selling Hot Selling products. Even suppliers in China have unique products, but it requires persistence and some extra work. HERE IS A RED HOT TIP: When searching B2B sites, go past the first few hundred suppliers and find ones that have no bells and whistles such as Gold, Verified, 5Star, Premium etc. symbols next to their name. I know this is contrary to what I write in my book, but I am there writing for people with absolutely no idea where to start. This advice will appear in my next revision, so those who read this are getting a pre-release bonus just for being Fastlane members.\n\nThose suppliers you will find by this method are generally the smaller manufacturers, some with little money to spend on advertising or buying status badges, some with little or no experience in exporting, and others just dipping their toe in the water to see if it is worthwhile. They are more likely to be the ones who have products not yet sold outside China. The more difficult it is for you to find suitable products and suppliers the more difficult it will be for potential competitors. (Barrier to Entry.)\n\nBut here is a suggestion that might save you some pain: Learn something about safe sourcing before you contact them.

The best answer I can give is to describe how I validated the market in another country for the product type which I had successfully sold and franchised at home. First I did all the research I could regarding the market for that product. Then I registered a company in that country and traveled there on a dry run sales mission, with a supply of catalogs from my home country.\n\nI visited potential customers and informed them that we were about to launch in that country, outlining why we had been so successful at home, emphasizing our two USPs - Free set up and good old-fashioned service. In most cases the response was great with invitations to send them literature and pricing as soon as possible.\n\nWith that relatively unsophisticated market survey information under my belt, I then began selling franchises within that country and soon the launch was under way.\n\n2. Trade shows can be very beneficial if you have a product that can be demonstrated. That did not suit my business. Direct mail was extremely successful, mainly because I was able to include a sample in each mailing, but also because I used attention grabbing headlines. Faxes worked very well also. No sample, but the headlines worked. Next most effective was cold calling. Very few people are suited to cold calling, so I devised a system of \"Warm Calling.\"\n\nThis boiled down to walking into the front office, handing to the receptionist what really consisted of a mailing package, but not in an envelope, with the request that she/he hand it to the person responsible for buying such products. It was quite common to get a call on my cell phone before I was half a mile away. OK, so I was playing messenger boy, but I had warm leads and made sales every day.\n\nPrint Yellow pages were highly effective because I broke the rules and filled the adverts with words. In more recent years we had a corporate website that was not a great producer. Conversion rates were low. It was very fancy; professionally produced. I wanted to try the many words approach, but met too much resistance from franchisees, so I can't say whether or not it would have worked.\n\nWalter", "DKNJ1985 said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nThanks for the info Walter.

That could still cost them big bucks.\n\nIt is not uncommon for people to go off half-cocked knowing almost nothing about what is involved in buying overseas. In effect they treat the overseas buying process as though they were buying from the corner store. Some even turn to me for help after they have ordered goods without knowing what to do about actually getting the goods delivered to them.\n\nI have on my files tales of woe that include one who ordered a large shipment of bulky goods. Great price! The problem was, this person discovered that freight was going to cost several times the value of the goods and by the time she came to me for help she had already paid for the goods. I find it hard to believe how careless some people can be with their own money.\n\nIf someone intends going it alone without obtaining expert guidance, they should at least think carefully about the project from start to finish. Here is a very brief step by step guide. Intending importers should at least complete the first two of the following steps before even starting to source products.\n\nMarket research. What to sell, how to sell it, are you sure you will be able to sell it, and what prices can you confidently expect to sell it for at a profit. That confidence must be based on thorough research, not just checking sold prices on eBay or Amazon.\nDetermine what maximum landed cost is affordable in order to be profitable, making sure you take into account all selling costs. See first point.\nSearch for suppliers using a safe sourcing site. Don\u2019t just go to any site casually suggested on forums, because on many of them everything is not what it appears. For example, \u201cVerified\u201d means the business actually exists. \u201cGold\u201d or \u201cPremium\u201d Supplier means they paid out hundreds or sometimes thousands of dollars to gain that status. Alibaba were for almost a year discounting that fee by 90%, so that means a whole lot more suppliers have bought status without scrutiny.\nRemember that Chinese businesses almost invariably trade under multiple different names, so bad reviews don\u2019t bother them and bad feedback rarely appears. They simply leave their bad record behind and trade under the next name on their list.\nAvoid suppliers falsely claiming to be manufacturers. Some popular B2B portals have big lists of suppliers claiming to be manufacturers, but they are not. They add their profit to the prices they pay real manufacturers. You lose that part of your potential profit.\nAvoid middle men falsely claiming to be wholesalers. They do not even carry inventory, but are opportunists who will offer for sale anything from paper clips to million dollar machinery.\nAvoid dropshippers too because they take profit out of your pocket.\nConduct due diligence on the chosen suppliers.\nConvince the supplier to allow you to order much less than their stated MOQ.\nGet quotes. Don\u2019t forget freight.\nBeware of freight collect quotes. A common scam in this area could lead to your bankruptcy.\nNegotiate payment terms. Beware of W.U., and Telegraphic Transfers. Scammers love them.\nEnsure that all costs to your door are covered and that you have them in writing.\nObtain sample/s. Beware of freight ripoffs in this part. Ask for delivery by the postal service.\n\nIf satisfied, place a small trial order crossing every \u201ct\u201d and dotting every \u201ci\u201d.\nPay deposit.\nPay balance as negotiated.\nCheck the goods.\nIf all is well to this point, you are in business. You can do your test marketing and be ready to place another order.\nNow this is not an exhaustive list, but it may help those who prefer to risk their money rather than seek expert advice. There is much, much, more. It takes me 83 pages to set it all out in detail for those new to importing.", "Hi Walter,\n\nIt's my first post in this thread so firstly I'll say thank you for sharing everything with us and also your book.  It certainly does provide some very useful information.\n\nIn your experience how difficult has it been getting manufacturers to supply new businesses with their product lines?  Especially those that have a name to protect and nurture.  It's almost the new graduate looking for a job; need experience to get a job to get experience.

It certainly does provide some very useful information.\n\nIn your experience how difficult has it been getting manufacturers to supply new businesses with their product lines?  Especially those that have a name to protect and nurture.  It's almost the new graduate looking for a job; need experience to get a job to get experience.  Or is it exactly like that to the point where you just keep pitching to manufacturers until someone gives you a break and you work from there?\nIt's ok if your intention is to just buy generic stuff from China and sell it on Ebay, etc.  They will sell to whoever has the money by the sounds of it but what of other industries where the manufacturers are the branders and they have whole lines that live within those banners?  I'd imagine they would be very reluctant to conduct business with any newly minted company.\n\nAlso, what are your thoughts on those manufacturers that have their own websites which they also sell products from and thus set their own RRP's?

They usually have a distribution network and are not interested in small fry. The post on Monday by @RoadTrip in his thread\nAmbiente Fair: Looking for Importing Advice is well worth reading in this context. Here's one invaluable statement: \"I've definitely been able to spot new trends, find companies without distribution in either EU or USA and even found some of the smaller companies who are just starting out and looking for any type of distribution.\"\n\nThere are many trade fairs in all western countries and at most of them you will find a mix of local suppliers and those from other countries. @RoadTrip found that the Chinese exhibitors offered very ordinary products, and I would add that many of them will only be traders. It is probably worth a visit to any fairs that might be connected to a niche market that interests you particularly if looking for someone looking for a distributor.\n\nThe picture is very different when you look for suppliers from outside your home country. As a general rule they will be much more eager to do business with you, but as I mention in Chapter 8.7, when contacting them you should invent a business name if you don't already have one. Big brand names from China should not even be considered because they will invariably be fakes, counterfeits, or illegally sold genuine items. Having goods branded with your own name is possibly a good alternative.\n\nI would not expect that manufacturers who are selling retail would be good suppliers for you, but I am not an expert in online marketing.", "How did you manage to find out information, make contacts, get capital, and find out what to do in the export business way back before the internet in the very beginning when you started in 1967?

I learned a lot from my work experience before starting my own business, and like all entrepreneurs in my day I knew how to use the information sources available.\n\nPrint Yellow Pages were indispensable, but if you wanted to look further afield than your own city, it was necessary to go to public libraries to use the YPs from other places. YPs provided information on suppliers and possible customers. This worked well for me until I started exporting in 1978.\n\nAlthough fax machines were commonly in use by then, most of my communication was text only, so I used Telex, and had my own cable address, as did most of my overseas customers. Finding those customers was quite an effort.\n\nI had already traveled overseas extensively on family holidays, and I used those trips to look for potential business, keeping detailed diaries. (Tax deductible holidays.) I also spent time looking for information sources and obtained business magazines from various countries. I found a lot of information through business organizations and Government bodies such as Chambers of Commerce, Official Trade Departments, Industry Organizations, and World Trade Centers.\n\nI am a great believer in networking, and as a result my mainland Chinese agent was found through a contact in Taiwan. Fortunately the economic reform program under Deng Xiaoping began that year and small entrepreneurs were popping up in major cities.\n\nMy use of networking paid off after I sold that business and started importing in 1987. I had numerous contacts in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, and other Asian countries, and they had offered me various products to import. Still without the internet, I used those contacts to gain information on suppliers, and I also used my knowledge of the organizations I mentioned above.\n\nWhere possible I obtained copies of English versions of the national YPs but more importantly, I subscribed to every trade magazine I could find. I used these extensively for product sourcing. Communication by this time was almost exclusively via fax.\n\nI did not use the internet until 1994, but still used faxes for a lot of communication, particularly drawings, until about 10 years later.\n\nAs for financing my export business, by the time I got to export, I had made sufficient profit to be able to use reserves to finance the purchase of the large amount of raw materials.", "Jinxus said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nI'm highly considering moving to China out of boredom and for life experience.

My main problem is with the food. I enjoy Chinese food in Western countries, but not the real thing in China. If you want to eat Western style, it will add considerably to your cost of living. If you buy Western style meals in many of the restaurants that specialize in them you will find that they will mostly taste Chinese. As a result you will have to pay big money to eat in top hotels if you want food that tastes familiar.\n\nThere are business advantages in living in certain cities, but to some extent that will depend on what product types are of interest to you. For overall business, big centers such as Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai would be hard to beat. Cost of living in Hong Kong will approximately equal your cost in New York, but cost in Beijing would be about half that. One thing that will cost you more in China is .... believe it or not .... clothing! That is, unless like me you shop in the little local clothing shops in the back streets.\n\nFinally, there is no doubt that if you are resident in China you will more easily gain the respect of business contacts.", "STRAIGHT FROM THE HORSE\u2019S MOUTH\nQuote from Alibaba.com under the heading: \u201cHow to find legitimate companies on Alibaba.com\u201d\n\u201c In short, a Gold Supplier on Alibaba.com is a company that has had their legal business licenses and contact persons verified. However, this does not automatically rule out all dishonest enterprises \u2013 it just means that the company is registered with the government, and has a valid license to operate a business.\u201d\n\n\"Registered with the Government\" simply means they have a business registration without which it is not possible to legally conduct a business in China.

The dropshippers I have found on places like Doba and WWB don\u2019t leave enough meat on the bone.\n\nA. Sorry but you are asking the wrong person. For a start I don\u2019t supply lists, I teach how to source supplies direct from the manufacturer.  Secondly, I don\u2019t recommend dropshipping as a business model, but because I get so many questions about dropshipping I will explain why. It is a long explanation but it answers a lot of the questions that I am so often asked.\n\nPros and Cons of Dropshipping\n\nI think that most members of the Fastlane forum know how dropshipping works, but in case Rip Van Winkle is online, here is a brief description:\n\nDropshipping is a business model that allows you to retail goods without holding any physical stock. Without any goods in your possession you advertise for sale those products that your dropship supplier has in stock.\n\nWhen you make a sale, you send all the sale details to the dropshipper who then ships the item out on your behalf. Your profit will be the difference between what you charge your customer and what the dropshipper charges you. Don\u2019t forget to allow for your selling costs, including Ebay fees, PayPal fees, postage etc. Some people even have to pay a dropship fee.\n\nPros:\n\nDropship wholesalers offer a vastproduct range for you to sell.\nYou do not need to outlay money for inventory.\nYour dropship supplier does most of the work for you, including packing and postage, although you still have to handle the sales and administration work\nTheoretically your bigger product range could lead to higher sales.\nYou don\u2019t even have to worry about storage space.\nYou can automate the process.\nYour dropship wholesalers might have photos that you can display on eBay or Amazon.\nCons:\n\nYou have no control over your own business. That can lead to very unhappy customers.\nYou might keep selling not knowing that the supplier is running out of stock.\nYour supplier may even discontinue a product line without informing you. That can result in bad feedback that will damage your business.\nDropshippers make mistakes, but you get the bad feedback.\nThose who promote dropshipping boast about their huge turnover, but they don\u2019t tell you how low their profits are. Dropship resellers posting on business forums generally report a profit margin of 20% or less, but there are a few who say they get 30%.\nMany sellers on Amazon and Ebay use the same dropship wholesalers, so there are often hundreds of sellers flooding the market with the same product.\nWhen you buy from dropship suppliers you are engaging in a business to business transaction and in almost all western jurisdictions that means you do not have protection under consumer protection laws. Your customers do. Even if they did not, they still get favoured treatment from eBay and PayPal and credit card companies, which means they can, and do, return the goods for any reason and claim a refund. If numerous customers do that, perhaps simply due to a recently announced product update, you now have an inventory of returned goods whether or not you have the funds to finance an inventory. Your suppliers will not give you a refund unless the items are faulty. Those selling via the dropship business model should not do so unless they have funds available to finance a large number of returns. \n\nIn order for an item to sell successfully especially on Amazon or Ebay, it has to be either unique, or a very desirable item. If you browse through dropshipping directories you will find it almost impossible to find items that meet these criteria except for those very desirable hot selling products that every man and his dog are selling at ridiculously low prices.", "Here is an interesting comment I read recently in another forum.

But I'm committed.Click to expand...\n\nThe safest is escrow, but not Alibaba's escrow which is full of traps for the unwary who don't read all the fine print. I have done so, and I find that there are contradictions in their rules. Contradictions leave loopholes for clever argument by suppliers or Alibaba.\n\nWhatever you do, don't use Western Union.  Sellers will usually accept T/T (more correctly called IMT, but Chinese business have not caught up with the 21st Century terminology). If you pay by T/T, only pay to the business bank account, not to an individual unless the individual named is clearly identifiable as a senior executive, preferably a director, of the business.\n\nManufacturers rarely accept credit cards or PayPal, but then, on Alibaba chances are you are dealing with a trader or wholesaler, and many of those will accept payment by those methods. If possible use your credit card through PayPal so that you get double barreled protection, but I suggest you read my post Q12 Sharing my lifetime experience in export/import.

Apart from the ethical question of basing your business on doing something illegal, another consideration is that if you try it on Amazon or eBay you will be banned.\n\nIf you find any suppliers in China that offer well-known brands for sale, you should run the other way. Most big brand goods being offered are counterfeits, but even if they are genuine, the problems are much the same.\n\nSuppliers of counterfeit products are notorious for scamming. Often, buyers of counterfeits receive nothing, other times they get a product that will work for a very short time, and sometimes, if it is electronics, they even get an empty shell.\n\nAlmost every big brand item offered for sale in China is not genuine.\nCustoms will usually confiscate the branded goods (genuine or counterfeit) on arrival. There goes your hard earned cash.\nDepending on the quantity and value, Customs may prosecute, with the possibility of heavy fines and/or imprisonment.\nOnce you are detected importing counterfeits, or illegal genuine big brands, your name and address will be flagged by Customs. This means every shipment ever after will be delayed while they do a thorough inspection.\nNo warranty, regardless of what the supplier might say, so you carry the cost of replacements when your customers discover how shoddy the products are.\nThere have been numerous cases of the brand owners suing and getting such big compensation payments that the illegal importer is bankrupted.\nAll this means that unless you are willing to sell branded items purchased at high prices (giving you very low margins) from authorized local distributors, you should consider importing generic products, but all is not lost. You can private label almost any product, and you don't need to buy large quantities to do this.", "Gurus-In-Training\n\nWell here I am having my first rant!\n\nI was recently sent a link to an importing \"expert's\" blog where I saw a question from a trusting enquirer who asked a question about how to handle the process of shipping a container by sea. The answer was so vague, unhelpful and plain wrong that if the enquirer followed the advice given he/she could have incurred massive unexpected costs, possibly running into the thousands.\n\nI have written before about the misinformation that is so often published by people who call themselves experts on importing, but this latest misinformation is among the worst I have seen and could send the intending importer broke. The information was free and I suppose the enquirer got his/her money's worth,(zero) but is it fair or ethical?\n\nThe problem I see is that most who set themselves up to sell expensive training courses on importing are actually highly experienced in online marketing, but know only what they have read about importing, or maybe they have blundered their way through the process of overseas sourcing and importing and because they eventually managed a few imports without disaster they think they know it all.\n\nI can't name all the Gurus-In-Training that I have encountered, but there are many of them, and some of them are making a fortune out of selling their courses.

I did it successfully because I manufactured my own products, I knew the market on a worldwide basis, and I had been involved in the shipping industry since I got my first job after college.\n\nThat does not mean you can't do it. You have some distinct advantages, in particular an understanding of the local language where you will source supplies, and a wife with highly appropriate experience.\n\n\nYou need to know the product and the market. That is where your wife can help. As a department store manager she would be able to tell you which manufacturers give good reliable service, and have products that would be desirable in your target market.   \n\nYou will need to learn shipping terminology, in particular Incoterms. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incoterms  There are other terms that you will have to learn such as Letter of Credit and Bill of Lading.\n\nYour biggest problem will be finding buyers. One way you can do that is register as a seller on Alibaba (I know I knock Alibaba, but that is for buyers. It is great for sellers.) You may have to pay their $699 fee to become a Gold Supplier. That is the current discounted rate on offer for the \"Lite\" version.There are other places where you can advertise for free, but that must be done in a manner that I will explain to you privately. Let me know when you are in need of that information.\n\nYour next biggest problem will be to establish good relationships with the manufacturers while acting as a a middleman, which they generally won't like.\nYou will have to be prepared to carry a small sample inventory to be able to ship to buyers wanting to check out the quality. For this you will have to negotiate very low rates with air couriers. Don't agree to pay any more than 50% of their schedule rates, but even lower prices are common. Cultivate an association with a good freight forwarder for larger shipments.\n\nCheck the garment sizing and make sure the manufacturer knows you are buying for women in western countries.\nThe Seoul Global Business Center will be able to help you with the business set up side of things, but probably won't be able to help much with other aspects of the business.

Now with the world being a global village manufacturing will move from country to country following low labor costs and also technical skills and material resources.\n\nOne symptom of this is the slow return of some manufacturing industries to their country of origin after manufacturing for 10 or 20 years in lesser developed countries.\n\nThis means that it may be possible to buy locally at prices equivalent to, or even less than you can buy from Asian or other low labor cost countries. It is certainly worth checking it out in relation to the type of product you are interested in selling.\n\nOne major drawback to this idea is that manufacturers in Western countries have a tendency to be reluctant to deal direct with small retailers, and insist on working through major distributors. This is a big factor in the growth of small importing businesses, because the distributors\u2019 margins eat into the profit margin available to small retailers.\n\nSearch for manufacturers in your home country who are advertising that they want to export. These are generally more entrepreneurial and may be more inclined to deal with smaller local businesses. There are a number of sourcing sites that relate specifically to one country, or you can inquire through your country\u2019s trade department responsible for exports.\n\nDon't just look at price. Take into account ease of communication, no international shipping costs or duty etc., you ability to more easily visit the manufacturer, and most importantly quality control.

That is the mourning color. Otherwise dress formally. A yachting jacket and trousers would be acceptable but a suit is better.\n\nChinese business people tend to dress conservatively, but with warmer weather coming on in the southern parts they may suggest casual wear. In that case never wear shorts.

Some, or even all of those other suppliers could be owned by the same owner, but they are possibly just traders who have pirated images. That is a very common practice. Many traders have no formal relationship with the manufacturers whose products they offer. They are just opportunists, hoping to get an order, and hoping the manufacturer will supply them. That is one reason why they tend to be inflexible on MOQs.\n\nMost Chinese companies trade under several different names and often they appear to compete with one another. One of my franchisees operating a territory in my former importing network placed a sizable order for a product bearing the logo of a good customer that was one of the big names in retail. Instructions were given that this design was not to appear in any advertising, and no samples bearing that logo were to be given out.\n\nThe manufacturer complied, but a related company soon displayed the design in their catalog. Our excellent relationship came into play, and after some firm words from me as head of the organization, the catalog was withdrawn. Relationships count for a lot.\n\nWhat you have experienced should be a warning to all about the lack of protection of IP rights in China. The government is trying to tidy it up, prosecuting some landmark cases, but with millions of businesses it is a slow process. This is why I have developed a relationship with a Chinese lawyer. He has prosecuted a number of cases but admits that the success rate is not what you might expect in the West.\n\nThe best protection is still: Develop strong relationships.", "Parallel Imports Canada\n\nIn my post on the subject of Parallel Imports USA Sharing my lifetime experience in export/import. Product sourcing specialist. I promised to post information specific to other countries on request. \n\nI have received such a request in relation to Canada, so here is information that might be useful for all Canadian Fastlaners interested in the subject. Please note that the legal disclaimer in that original post applies also to this one.\n\nThis one is quite easy to answer because most of what I wrote in the article covering Parallel Imports to the USA will also apply to Canada. The main exception is the absence any recordation number system, so please read the original article but ignore that part.\n\nCanada's courts have in my view been more generous towards importers than those in the US.  I should point out that the most important issue that I see for Canadian importers is to declare any substantial difference that may exist between the parallel import product and the locally available product.\n\nIn Canadian courts there have been a number of failed attempts, and one or two successful ones, by trade mark or copyright holders to prevent parallel imports of their branded products. With this in mind, I have here a link to a lengthy article (62 Pages) published by the Canadian Bar Association under the title: \"Grey Goods V Counterfeit Goods - What's the Difference?\"        http://www.cba.org/cba/niagara2010/PDF/5.2 Manson_Grey Goods v. Counterfeit Goods.MDM.GHC.lmo.pdf\n\nI would like to point out what to me is a major item in the article. Substantial delays can occur if shipments are suspected of being counterfeit and not genuine. Because of this it is vital to have correct and detailed documentation accompanying the shipment and provided to your Customs Broker or Freight Forwarder. The documentation must include proof of authenticity, and location of your purchase. It should also show proof that the person or business selling the goods to you was authorized to do so.\n\nIt is also vitally important that there must not be any labeling suggesting or claiming that you are an authorized distributor, or that local or international warranties will be honored by the manufacturer or brand owner.\n\nI would only carry out parallel importing with the assistance of a licensed Customs Broker, or a Freight Forwarder that employs one. I would also be sure to inform them clearly that the goods being imported are parallel imports.\n\nAnyone seriously considering the huge potential of this activity might regard it as a worthwhile investment to buy the book Parallel Importation by Rose Ann MacGillivray. It is available for $109 from http://www.carswell.com/product-detail/parallel-importation/", "Walter:\n\n1. I'm preparing to place my first sample order with a supplier in Shanghai.

Thank you!\n\neticketClick to expand...\n\nThe difference between FOB and EXW is:\n\nWith FOB you are responsible for all costs from the time the goods are loaded on board the transport at the FOB point stated (in this case Shanghai), whether ship or plane.\nWith EXW you are responsible for all costs from the time the goods leave the supplier's loading dock. With door to door air courier shipments that cost is included anyway.\nSo, you have got it right that FOB Shanghai  means that you would pay from Shanghai port to U.S. port, BUT,  it also means you are responsible for all costs from the time the shipment reaches the US port until it gets to your door.

What would you say are some ranges from which to lower the true value of the goods.  That is, what is 'safe' but enough to realize savings, and what is absurd.

Click to expand...\n\nThanks for your review. I don't make a point about boasting how much money the book can save people who use it, but many of my readers have said what you have, that it has saved them a load of money. It's like people saying what's so special about a quality European car? - it's all just show. Once they drive one they know what's special.\n\nYour questions:\n\n1. The significant differences are that a) A Customs Broker has specialized knowledge of rules and regulations that can keep you out of trouble, reduce the chances of paying too much duty, and help you avoid importing things that are restricted or require special labeling. b) A good freight forwarder will work in your best interests to get the best price and most efficient freight for you. The savings can be huge, but you need to build a good relationship with them. I prefer to use a smaller forwarder, but they should employ an in-house Customs Broker.\n\nEven if they do have one in-house, you can use both at the same time. Your Customs Broker can work with the forwarder and you can get the best of both worlds. The Customs Broker is better equipped to give you advice in advance of you placing an order, so you don't proceed to that point if he raises a red flag.\n\n2. I don't like to be negative about specific experts or courses, but their reference to air freight is I believe, due to a careless approach common to what is taught by the majority of importing experts. Their treatment of sea shipments is likewise casual and potentially extremely costly. \n\nIt is important to understand the difference between air freight and air couriers. See Chapter 5, in particular 5.1 and 5.2. Briefly for our Fastlane readers: Both relate to delivery by air. Air freight refers to a service from Airport to Airport, but air couriers provide a service Door to Door. Believe me a newbie does not want to learn the hard way how to collect a shipment from the airport. It is not nearly as traumatic as collecting a shipment from a sea port, but until you know the basics by learning what your freight forwarder has previously done, it will likely not be a happy experience.\n\nThat is why I advise against using air freight until you have some experience. It would be different matter if you are using a freight forwarder. If you ask them to advise the best freight method, including delivery to your door, and they have recommended air freight, I would normally choose to accept their advice. The caveat is that the written quote must include all charges to your door.\n\nAs a general rule, small shipments will travel most cost effectively via air courier, but if you are building a relationship with a forwarder, ask them. They may have spare air container space that they will gladly fill at low cost to you.\n\nBest wishes in developing your importing empire.\n\nWalter", "I use terapeak for my product research, do you know of other good ways to do product research?\nTerapeak is not available to my country (The Netherlands) so i use the UK version.

One important thing I have learned is that Terapeak is probably a bit misleading in the results it gives. One online marketing expert that I respect, is adamant that the best resource is eBay's completed listings. This is because it shows you what has sold, and the actual prices achieved. In looking at these listings you should not include shipping cost unless the listing is in your home country.\n\nThat may be helpful, but I think you would get a far more helpful answer from @Ecom man. He has a lot of experience and certainly seems to know what he is talking about in relation to selling on eBay.", "Alibaba\u2019s Trade Assurance Service.  I know that many of my readers are wedded to Alibaba as their primary sourcing site regardless of the problems I have highlighted. Just because those readers won't take my advice is no reason for me to neglect them, so I have looked at this new service of Alibaba's.\n\nIt would seem on the surface to provide a far better level of safety than the old escrow system, now called Secure Payment. But...\nAlibaba\u2019s Trade Assurance Service is not without difficulty for buyers. I suggest you read the relevant Terms and Conditions, (T & C) but in particular the following:\n\n2.4, 2.6, 5.5, 5.5.1, 7.3, 7.5, 9.5.1, 9.5.2, 10.2.4, 10.3, 10.4, 11.3,11.4, 11.5, 11.6, 11.7, 11.13, 11.14, 14.6.5, 15.5.\n\nBecause I know that few will bother to check out the huge page full of technicalities, I will draw attention to some very important matters found in the (T & C) plus some important things that they do not specify.\n\nAlibaba have the absolute right to decide if your money will be handed over to the supplier. No right of appeal.\n\nClaims that the product is faulty must be made before the goods are delivered!\n\nThey say in 7.5  \u201cBuyer may confirm the shipping invoice within 15 calendar days after Seller uploaded the evidence of shipment\u201d, but they do not explain this very important clause. \u201cConfirming the shipping invoice\u201d is not mentioned anywhere else in the T&C.\n\nData recorded by One Touch, Alibaba, and Alibaba.com constitute almost the only evidence admissible in dealing with a claim. This means it is imperative that you keep screen shots of every transaction, every page visited, every attachment sent to you or by you, every email to or from your supplier and to or from Alibaba and OneTouch. You can provide other supporting evidence, but it certainly appears that it is inconsequential.\n\nHere is 10.2.4 in full: \u201c10.2.4 In the event of a dispute between Buyer and Seller on product quality, Buyer should raise a complaint before Seller delivered the product.  The product verification report issued by a product verification company obtained by Buyer shall serve as the basis of determination on whether or not the products are in line with the agreed product quality standards.\u201d  This implies, but does not clearly state, that you should have every shipment inspected before the goods leave the factory. See important note below. The inspection cost will be yours.\n\nNow, if you have digested that, here is 10.3 in full: \u201c10.3 After Buyer submitted a request for Alibaba to resolve a dispute on product quality, Buyer shall instruct one of the designated Product Inspection Company to inspect the products and pay for the relevant inspection fees. Alibaba shall make a determination on the dispute based on the product inspection report issued by the Product Inspection Company.  If Buyer and Seller did not expressly agree on the quality standards required of the products, the Product Inspection Company shall have the right to issue the quality standards report based on the relevant industry standards.  Alibaba shall have the right to reject any product inspection reports issued by other product inspection companies.  If the products cannot be inspected due to reasons or faults attributable to a particular party, such party shall be liable for any damage or liability that arises therefrom. \u201c  The bolding and underlining are Alibaba\u2019s. Put simply it means you will have to pay for another inspection, using an inspection service of Alibaba\u2019s choosing. In the past they have specified SGS, which will cost you about $350 or more. This clause also highlights the requirement to precisely specify quality standards. Few importers will have the technical knowledge to do this and will have to have specifications drawn up by an engineer familiar with the particular type of product being ordered, and in keeping with your specific requirements included. Cost to you $????.\n\nThe other major point I would make is that if you pay a deposit, that will be covered by Trade Assurance if you ask for it and the supplier agrees, but if you pay the balance before shipment, that is not covered.  See Clause 10.4\n\nIf your deposit is below the US$1,000 minimum you can\u2019t get cover anyway.\n\nBefore using Trade Assurance, it would be a good idea to carefully read all the T&Cs to be sure that you have dotted every i and crossed every t.\n\nIMPORTANT!  If the goods have been delivered there is no possibility of making a claim. They do not specify what \"delivered\" means, but that could depend on the terms of contract. If FOB, the goods have been delivered when loaded on a carrier. If EXW, the goods have been delivered as soon as they leave the supplier's dock.\n\nFinally, note that the English version of the rules published on Alibaba\u2019s site is not binding, only the Chinese version. There is a partial (non-operative) link to the Chinese version at the end of the T&Cs. Those of you fluent in Mandarin may be able to locate an active link.", "Walter:\n\nI've been off the fastlaneforum grid for a couple of weeks, but I finally got a quote today from my Chinese supplier.

If they are a manufacturer, there would be a good chance of doing so.\n\nThere is only one way to be certain that the supplier is a real manufacturer. That is if they have been inspected and certified as such by one of the big European inspection companies such as SGS. Even if you visit the factory you can't be sure. The two preferred sites mentioned in my book do provide certainty because they have engaged such services to do genuine audits.\n\nI would be happy to check them out for you if you like.

Following my recent post explaining Alibaba\u2019s Trade Assurance system, I have been asked questions about non-delivery and quality failure.\n\nQ. Can you confirm that if the goods are not shipped, my money will be refunded? Also, what happens if the goods arrive but are not of the quality ordered? How can I prove it?\n\nA. Trade Assurance covers not only pre-shipment quality assurance , but also a guarantee that the quoted delivery date will be complied with as well as. What that implies is that if the goods are not shipped at all, as happens sometimes, the money will not be transferred to the seller's account.\n\nThe loophole there is that false documents can be presented showing that the goods have been shipped when they have not.  You should note that if the goods are not shipped but you have paid to have a pre-shipment inspection, that inspection fee will not be refunded. You have lost several hundred dollars.\n\n\n\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\nIt is also possible that genuine documents can be presented, but when delivered, the contents of the shipment are found to be not as described. This often happens on a small scale, but it is just as easy for scammers to do it on a large scale. You order machinery, they load the same weight of pebbles instead.\n\nIf you have not had a pre-shipment inspection, there is no point in trying to prove that the quality is not as agreed. There is no protection for instances of goods arriving at destination, but not being as described, or not of the agreed quality, so a pre-shipment inspection must be done and must include sealing of the shipment.\n\nNOTE: A buyer's use of a pre-shipment QA inspection service is optional, but unless that inspection is done no claim could possibly succeed, so without it the use of Trade Protection is pointless. Why would Alibaba allow for that inspection to be optional, when failure to do it would nullify the protection arrangement?", "Walter:\n\nI have 2 questions.\n\n1.

I think your problem is that Alibaba is overloaded with traders.\n\nYou should appreciate that China is a nation of entrepreneurs. At least wannabee entrepreneurs, most of whom don't have the financial resources or the skills to set up a manufacturing business. On the other hand, the western world sees China as an Aladdin's cave of treasures they can buy cheaply.\n\nFor the wannabee entrepreneurs, the only way to capitalize on that vast opportunity is to buy and sell. In other words become traders.\n\nAlibaba and the other big B2B sites make it possible for them to do this with almost no capital. They can set up a business with a one room office, (I have seen plenty of them) register on the B2B site for very little cost, identify themselves as manufacturers because they know that's what western buyers look for, make a sale, receive a deposit, then persuade a manufacturer to supply them.\n\nThis is a long story, and I may post a detailed report one day, but I think I have written sufficient for you to see why you are constantly encountering traders.

Going personally can help in many cases, but from what you say I would not hold out great hopes of getting those manufacturers to improve their QC. It could be that they can produce what you want, but at a higher price. You need to calculate whether that would be worthwhile. Personally seeing their production facilities and quality of recent production could help you determine that.\n\nA cheaper and possibly more effective option is to tell them that you want to have production or pre-shipment QC inspections done before you will pay the balance. That is often sufficient to smarten them up, but you may need to follow through and do it. I suggest using SGS or one of the others I mention in my book.

If the former is the case, what should a beginner start using?\n2) Is duty incorporated into FOB or CIF or is it a separate fee you pay?\n\nThanks so much for all your help!Click to expand...\n\nHi Mike,\n\n1. You should always have the option to choose FOB or CIF, or any other freight option you might prefer. It is almost universal for suppliers to initially quote FOB, but depending on the size and value of the shipment you might want to use air courier, air freight, or sea freight. For either of the last two everyone, not only beginners, should ask two or three local freight forwarders near you to quote. The written quotes should include door to door delivery, including customs clearance.  If using air couriers, ask the supplier to quote. They will usually be able to get better rates than you can. The I in CIF stands for Insurance. Insurance is optional.\n2. Duty is very rarely included in any freight quotes. If it is, that is known as Delivered Duty Paid. (DDP) In almost every case you have to pay the duty separately. Air Couriers automatic all pay it for you and bill you for it, sometimes before and sometimes after delivery to you.\n\nRegarding FOB quotes, it is common in China for that term to be incorrectly used. In practice a supplier will often mean Ex Works (EXW), so you need to know where the FOB begins. It should be at the port (air port or sea port) of loading. If it is EXW there can be massive internal charges from the supplier's dock to the point where it is loaded on overseas transport. Never accept an EXW quote unless your freight forwarder advises you to do so.\n\nWalter", "FAKE CERTIFICATES\n\nToday a young entrepreneur asked me to help him by checking the validity of CE and ROH Certificates for an item he had considered importing. He told me that the sample looked good, but I had to give him the sad news that the certificates are fakes. The certificates were the best looking forgeries I have yet seen.\n\nAccording to the certifying authority the Certificates do not exist. This is the notice they posted in response to my search:\n\"Sorry, the certificate does not exist \nwarn of fake CE certificates \n\n\nFake CE conformance certificates are a growing menace in the safety industry. An increasing number of products are being sold, which have never been properly tested and are accompanied by fake CE certificates. This is putting lives at risk and exposing employers to possible prosecution. The certificate shown on the right is a fake, supposedly issued by a Anbotek test house, but in reality this product was never tested by them. The product does not perform to the strict requirements of EN xxxxx.\"\n\nThe forging of certificates of every kind is endemic in China. This not only refers to such safety issues as those involved with CE and ROH certificates, but even business registration certificates are being forged.\n\nThis brings into question the validity of verification of suppliers on many B2B sites such as Alibaba, DHGate, TradeKey, GlobalSources etc., where the first step in the verification process involves inspection of business registration certificates. This issue highlights why I only recommend using certain safe sites where verification is taken seriously.\n\nFor those who have not read previous posts I would add that the second and final step in the verification process involves a visit by the B2B site operators to the business premises to confirm that the business is operating at that address. I am familiar enough with China to know that rent for the day offices abound. This means that scammers can rent an office for a few dollars until the visit has taken place, then close the door and operate their \"business\" from another location where they can't be traced.\nBy the way, after passing that rigorous verification process, they can then send a check for as little as $699 and provided the check is paid by the bank, they become much more trustworthy Gold Suppliers (or premium, or 5 Star etc.)", "First of all, I want to thank you for having started this thread here.

After the payment, please give us bank slip for our confirmation.\nFor the large orders need to declare for customs, customs declaration is impossible via paypal or escrow.

They will tell you soon enough.

Most \"experts\" will tell you to do so, but there are good reasons why you should not and I teach why you don't need to. This issue is even more critical in the early stages. If you try to talk the price down early on you will suddenly find no more emails arrive.\nThere are a few things you should say:\n\nTell them you are an established importer.\nTell them quality is important to you.\nAsk them for a copy of their catalog, preferably a printed version.\nGive them your business name.

I have been looking for leather jackets but all the prices I have been quoted seem too cheap for them to be real leather. Can suppliers call the product leather if it isn't?\n\nA. They should not but they very often do. Resellers like yourself have often been caught out selling fake leather as real leather because that's what they thought it was.\n\nTo understand how they can be fooled you need to know something about the lengths Chinese manufacturers might go to to fool the unwary or ignorant. In China all is not always as it seems. I will deal with leather first, but many other products are also faked in a way that can fool many people.\n\nFake leather is often impregnated with a leather perfume. Smells like leather - must be leather? You can tell the difference if you can find an obscure place where you can snip off a tiny piece. Heat it very hot and if it is fake it will give off a plastic smell. If it is genuine it will smell a bit like burning flesh.  No need to check if they identify it as PU  Leather - that's Polyurethane. Faux Leather is fake leather. But.... often they just say leather when it is not. Using a powerful magnifying glass, look for tiny bubbles in the cut edge of the \"leather\". Faking techniques have improved, and those bubbled edges can be sealed with a hot knife, so if the edge is smooth - it's fake.\n\nHere are a few examples of other fake processes:\nStainless Steel is often chrome plated steel. In some cases I have seen items painted to resemble stainless steel and it looks very authentic. Test: If a magnet sticks it is usually not stainless steel.\nGold Plating is often brass plating. In a test my importing business conducted some years ago, we found that most women preferred jewelry that was brass plated, thinking it was more attractive and was the real gold. Test: Brass is harder than gold of more than 14ct, so try scratching it.\nBrass Castings are often made out of what is called a water extendable resin impregnated with brass filings or flakes. These give it some weight and make it possible to polish it like real brass. Test: Look for tiny holes at the base of the casting. They are produced by the bubbles in the resin rising to the top. The casting is made upside down.\n\nThe moral of the story is to never take things at face value, particularly if the price seems way under what you would expect to pay.", "Walter I am very grateful that you give so much value to this topic and forum for all of us here present.

Different customs brokers do tend to sometimes apply different tariff numbers and that could be the explanation. It might pay you to get a ruling as explained by @Vigilante here: Addicted to Passive Income Deposits That way you will know for sure what duty you will have to pay.\n\nI would also get quotes from several freight forwarders for door to door shipment by the most economical method they can offer, but with preference for air freight (not air courier). Air freight can take a few days to a week longer, but it's usually a lot cheaper than air couriers and a lot quicker than sea freight. The quote should include all charges so that your only extra outlay will be to pay duty and tax.\n\nSometimes air freight can be cheaper than sea freight even on sizable shipments. It depends on how much freight your forwarder ships by air and what is available at the time. If you find a good freight forwarder who will actually do the best they can for you, the costs can be very low. If you are making frequent shipments they will want your business.\n\nFreight cost is not the only consideration, as you are obviously aware. There is also opportunity cost.

That is often the case with suppliers on Alibaba, DHGate, Tradekey and other sites where thousands of suppliers  falsely claim to be manufacturers.\n\nPayment by T/T is not foolproof, but is safer than WU or MoneyGram provided you take care.

Any advice from a cultural perspective on dealing with Japanese manufacturers? Thanks!Click to expand...\n\nDealing with Manufacturers in Japan.   While there are many similarities in dealing with manufacturers in China and Japan, there are some notable differences.\n\nPossibly the most important I have found from my experience is that Japanese suppliers will always supply what they promise, and on time or before. (Usually exactly on time.) It is very common for a Japanese business to surpass their promises regarding quality and attention to detail. For them, customer satisfaction is paramount, and in fact is a matter of honor.\n\nIf they say yes, that means yes, whereas in China that response can have a very wide range of meanings all the way through to meaning no. They won't say yes when they mean not, but generalized answers to your questions are not due to them being evasive, but simply their way of trying to avoid offending you. Little by little you will get the full information, but it might need patience.\n\nNegotiations must be done slowly and gently. Don't try too hard or too quickly to get a lower price. They may be willing to give a much lower price, but will not do so if you are seen as too pushy. They would rather do without your business.\n\nBuilding a relationship with a Japanese manufacturer requires a slow and painstaking process. Observe politeness and avoid much personal comment or worse still, questions. You can be very business-like and forma, because  that is seen as evidence of your \n\nIf visiting Japan, note that formalities are even more important in Japan than in China. For example, exchange of business cards is even more ceremonial for Japanese business people than it is for Chinese. Give or receive a business card with both hands, not one. If seated during the transaction, place the card on the table near you and leave it there until discussions end. Then place it in your business card holder. Don't just put it in your pocket or wallet. Whereas in China, an English only card is acceptable (though not totally desirable), in Japan it is imperative to have one side printed in Japanese, otherwise you will cause offence.\n\nBecause of the importance of etiquette, I suggest spending a few dollars on \"Etiquette Guide to Japan: Know the Rules that Make the Difference!\" by Boye Lafayette De Mente.

A large number of the traders listed on Alibaba, supposedly as manufacturers, are in this category.\n\nHere's how the system works for most traders:\n\nThey get a free listing on Alibaba, at least as verified suppliers. \n\nIt might not bring in any orders, so, if they have a small amount of capital they buy a Gold Supplier badge. \n\nSo far, no real checking is done except to see if they at least do have a physical address and have registered a business. \n\nThey advertise, usually at a low price with a high MOQ. \n\nBuyers make inquiries and they hurriedly contact manufacturers in the hope of finding one that will supply them. \n\nThey then load their margin on and quote you. \n\nThey will usually not reduce the MOQ, because they fear that the manufacturer either won't supply, or will increase the price. \n\nIf the price looks good and you order, they take your deposit and place an order with the manufacturer. \n\nSometimes, if they have an idea of the usual price, they will not follow step 5 until they have received your deposit.

Here is my answer, plus some extra for all my readers:\n\nMost transactions that are less than a few thousand dollars, and even many large ones, are paid by wire transfer.\n\nIt is true that there is no protection if you use wire transfer, also known as T/T. Your only protection is due diligence to be sure you are dealing with a genuine supplier, and you must send payment to the business bank account. Sometimes a supplier will ask you to pay by T/T to the owner's personal account. This could be a sign that they are scammers, but that is not necessarily the case.\n\nChina's banking system is not very liberated and business people there try every possible way to minimize their bank charges and also their taxes. They may or may not be doing something illegal, and you would offend them deeply if you asked probing questions. Most buyers would take the view that unless they know for certain, it is better to assume the supplier is not breaking any laws. \n\nIt is still advisable to check out the company very thoroughly, and make sure the person whose name you are given really is the owner. Over many years of importing I have never been scammed at all, and most of the payments I have made have been via T/T. Maybe 10% of those went to individuals who were the owners of the business.\n\nIt is unusual for genuine manufacturers to accept PayPal or CC, but I know of some that do. If the amount is worth it (Over $2,000) you could use escrow.com if the supplier agrees. They are unlikely to agree unless you offer to pay the fees. You could also use a Letter of Credit (L/C).\n\nAn L/C has to be arranged and paid for at the time of ordering, and specifies exactly what you are ordering; quantity, quality, value, shipping method, latest shipping date, and anything else you want to insist on.\n\nOnce the supplier has exactly fulfilled every item required in the L/C he can present it to his bank and will be paid. If he fails to do exactly as specified, payment will be withheld.\n\nIt is usual to require proof of loading on transport, in the form of an Air Waybill for air freight or Bill of Lading for sea shipments. This means that the supplier has to send you the goods and prove it, before he gets paid. This is an unbeatable quality guarantee, because once you have your copy of the Air Waybill or Bill of Lading, you are in possession of a negotiable document similar in legal standing to a bank check. Instead of cash, when you hand it over to the carriers they give you your goods.\n\nIf the supplier has sent you sub-standard products you have no legal obligation to pay him by any method at all.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: I am not providing legal advice.\nWalter", "Hi, Walter.

She buys retail in an EU country other than the UK where she lives, then ships the goods to the UK and sells at a lower price than the UK manufacturer! The brand owner threatened legal action although they did not have a leg to stand on.\n\nThe UK manufacturer is making exorbitantly huge profits in the UK, and desperately wanted to avoid competition.\n\nAlthough I never offer legal advice, when I informed her of the relevant EU legislation that unequivocally allows resale rights anywhere in the EU if the goods are purchased in the EU, she resisted their demands. They huffed and they puffed, but did not proceed with litigation. She is now continuing to run her very profitable business, giving a fair deal to customers who are denied that fair deal when they buy from the manufacturer.\n\nIt is worth noting that the manufacturer sells direct and does not sell to wholesalers or resellers in the UK.\n\nIn practice it seems that trademark owners in the EU have almost iron-clad protection from the sale of goods imported from countries outside of the EU, but the EU is a single market and those who profiteer in one EU country can get caught out as in this case.\n\nWalter", "Bought the book and read it, now currently reading through all 27 pages of this thread.

Brown, Thanks for you kind comments. It is great to see that your learning process is bearing fruit.\n\nYou have introduced an issue that is of great importance to other members and I hope others will take note. Persistence is a very important factor. Maybe some will also contribute their ideas on sourcing unmarketed products. \n\nMany manufacturers don't advertise at all. I once needed a supplier for a small product that I was selling lots of, but I knew I was not sourcing direct from the manufacturer. Ultimately I found the factory - probably the only one in China - via the Chinese Yellow Pages. I visited them and found them on a hillside above a small rural village. Unlike most others that I visited the reception area at the factory was tiny and dirty. (Barrier to Entry?) The dirtiness was due to the dirty nature of the production process. When the owner came out to meet me he was wearing dirty overalls because he was a hands-on manager.  It did not put me off, because now I was one of their very few direct customers, and that gave me a great market advantage.\n\nNow to your question: Your supplier might have misunderstood your request for a quote to include the customs clearance charge. DHL normally include standard customs clearance work in their door to door express service. I think the supplier might think you wanted the quote to include duty. The Incoterm for that is DDP. You could make it clear to them that you are not asking for DDP. Suppliers will almost invariably pre-pay the freight charge, but DDP is near impossible to get.\n\nBecause it is difficult to explain once a supplier is confused, I suggest that it is worth the small risk that the freight quote will not include the clearance work, and just accept the freight quote on the basis of door to door delivery. I would be very surprised if there will be substantial charges. DHL normally charge about $35, plus 2% of the amount they pay out for you (duty and tax).\n\nFor your benefit as well as for other readers, I always refer to customs clearance as \"customs clearance work\", not as \"customs clearance charges.\" It is very important to make allowance for the low level of English ability in dealing with people in China.\n\nWalter", "Walter Hay said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\n@S.

It simply can't be done from a distance.\n\nFreight rates will vary and like any purchase it pays to shop around.

One reason for their higher charges is that they will usually have their own offices in China and that is more expensive than working through local operators.\n\nA small factory such as you visited in Dongguan could be more adaptable than a big manufacturer, so it is quite possible that they can upgrade their quality for you.

Better for her to lose $4,000 than to spend another $5,000 on freight for a product that she might have been able to sell for $6,000.

Customs could seize the sample, but chances of that are slim.\n\nOnce they provide the certificate it is important to check its authenticity. See my previous post on this subject. It would be too costly for you to have the testing done unless you are going to handle large quantities.\n\nI should add that a CE mark does not relate to quality. The build or design could be terrible but if it conforms with EU health, safety, and environmental standards it can still be certified CE.\n\nWalter", "Ronak said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nRecently used an inspection service and wanted to post my feedback.

Respect for Intellectual Property rights (IP) is very low, and it is often the case that copies hit the market even before the innovator gets his/her prototype.\n\nIf I may generalize, the Chinese tend to be copiers rather than innovators, and without very precise specifications for a new project there can be many false starts.\n\nI would prefer to have a new product made in places like the US, Australia, or Israel. These are all countries that excel in innovation in electronics.  Cost of production may be a bit higher, although you could be surprised. \n\nIf tooling is required, you can sometimes have that made in China, where tooling costs are way below what they are in western countries, but if tooling for several components is required, I would have them made in different factories so that none see the finished product. It might even be possible to have components made in different factories in China, and assembled elsewhere.\n\nRegarding quality in general, China can produce excellent quality if it is required and specified and if buyers are willing to pay a little more for it. When I began importing in 1987, the availability of better quality from China compared to what I was able to get from local manufacturers was a key factor.

Your experience certainly is typical, and recounting it as you have should be helpful to any members who are considering a trip to China. \n\nThere is a fine line between manufacturing, and assembling of components. Almost every manufacturer will be assembling or at least processing components sourced outside. Very few will be completely vertically integrated.\n\nIn the case of the product you are researching, I would venture to say that the only part that any manufacturer could do for themselves without massive investment in technology and equipment is the steel frame. The ABS material for example requires very specific expertise to manufacture in the form you saw it, and although in that case the molds can be made at relatively low cost, the equipment needed to handle those molds is hugely expensive.\n\nI would have no hesitation in describing the company you visited as a manufacturer.\n\nI hope you enjoyed your hour long Jasmine tea drinking session!\n\nWalter", "Hi Walter,\n\nFirst, thank you for taking your time to answer all these questions for us. \nThe question I have for you is this (may have been covered, but 29 pages is a lot to sift through):\n\n- When starting out, would you recommend building a brand to sell your item(s) through existing sales channels (eBay, Amazon etc.), build an ecommerce site, or sell through an unbranded account on an existing sales channel (such as a personal eBay account)?\n\nCheers\nJames"], "Page29": ["Walter Hay said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nFTZs were originally set up to promote manufacturing in the US by importers bringing in components rather than completed goods.

I'm seriously planning on buying your book, hopefully after I get to know the importing processes and regulations of my country first. Rest assured, I know that I won't be disappointed when purchasing your tome.Click to expand...\n\nI will answer your points and questions in order.\n1. Your point 1 partly answers question 2 regarding whether toys are a good category to start with. It seems to me, although more expert internet marketers might provide better advice, that if you have found a niche with demand but low levels of competition, it could well be worth pursuing. Does you research tell you that you can make a good profit at the prices you have been quoted, plus all costs?\n2.  It's difficult to answer regarding labeling costs without more information, but there could be lower cost options. A charge of $170 for a \"printing mold\" is excessive unless it is for  a large area of foil stamping. For other types of printing a mold is not required unless they are referring to a screen for screen printing. In that case the charge is excessive unless it is a very large screen.               \n         Your reference to the die cut suggests that the packaging is cardboard. If so, a cutting die charge of $100 is towards the high end for China, but if it includes the setting up charge to diecut the box shape, that would be reasonable. \n         A mandatory minimum of 2,000 pcs for packaging suggests that they are not really interested in private labeling for you. It could be worth shipping the product without POS packaging, and having it made locally.  If more than one model could fit the same size box, that would make for economy. Other labeling methods could be used rather that direct on package printing.\n3. EXW is ex works and means all costs and risks from the factory door are yours. You would need to get a freight forwarder to quote door to door for you. Freight can be extremely high per until on some toys because of their volume/weight ratio. I suggest that you get some freight quotes before you do much more. You will need unit weight, carton dimensions and weight, plus number of cartons to get a quote.                 \n          Your request for assorted models was reasonable, but probably premature, which is why it was rejected. Negotiate slowly.\n4. Requesting 40 different samples at the one time was not a good idea. A flea market stall holder could potentially do well if he could obtain that many samples from various suppliers. It is common to charge for samples and freight is invariably added, but doubling the unit price for samples is probably due to you requesting so many. Be content with representative range to begin with. At this stage the supplier might not concede much because he has already quoted a price.\n5. China Post do have a standard parcel service, not express. The express post service will usually be much higher than air couriers charge. Standard service will be slow, taking as long as a month.\n6. Payment of 100% with order is way too risky. Maybe they are concerned about high bank fees on two transactions instead of one, but I would advise against paying 100% up front.  30% deposit is common. Balance when goods are ready to ship is usual. L/C is often arranged on a 100% basis and the terms should be payment upon presentation of appropriate documents. If they have the L/C they are guaranteed payment by the bank provided they strictly comply with the terms and conditions of your order as set out in the L/C. It is safest for both parties. Check out you bank's fees for both options.\n          If the total value warrants spending $250 to $350 I would recommend using one of the inspection services I have previously written about, and their tick of approval would be required before the L/C would be paid.\n\nWalter", "Walter Hay said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nI will answer your points and questions in order.\n1.

Chaining up the conversation for each point:\n\nThe total landed cost has not been exactly determined yet. What I did was to inflate the factory unit prices by almost three-fold to make sure expenses such as duty, tax, freight, brokerage, and other handling fees are safely covered given the number of cartons to be shipped as initial order while still maintaining competitive yet profitable selling price for each product. It's really a big risk given the average MOQ for both sizes to be approximately 40 per design. And each unit is not that cheap either when ordering by bulk with such per MOQ.\nIt seems private labeling becomes a complicated matter when it comes to multiple SKUs with different designs, colors, and sizes. Essentially, the products only come with 2 distinct sizes, but with large design varieties. The packaging material stated are either PP Box or Window Box (seems like cardboard enclosure with transparent plastic on the front portion), the latter is cheaper. So I'm not sure what they mean by printing mold and the die cut, since they generalize it for both types of packaging. By the way, the packaging are not that big so perhaps what you said it's true that they are charging excessively for private labeling. The mandated 2000 pieces MOQ is probably because they outsource the packaging; so it might be through contract agreement that they should acquire such amount as minimum or else the printing/packaging company won't supply.\nI have yet to ask for specific quotes for FOB and CNF terms; however, the supplier does mention that FOB costs approximately $500 without mentioning how many cartons to be shipped and whether is is via air freight or sea freight. I thought that fee for FOB (with specific location, usually) adjusts itself depending on the volume and weight of shipment - I got the unit weight, carton dimensions on quote. So, I'm not sure how they get $500 since they stated as \"per order basis\". As of now, I'm planning on finding local freight forwarders to help out with shipment consolidation and delivery. Additionally, I've heard that it would be better for new importers to recommend DAT for air cargo or CNF for sea freight, or any sort that would ensure shipment arrives at destination country and ready for domestic port pick-up to deliver-to-door, do you recommend this method as well?\nDo you recommend that I ship 20 samples at a time? They did suggest reducing my sample order to half (from the original 40) but the quote they gave me is still for 40 pieces with really high unit price, stating the unit price will be the same whether for batch of 20 or batch of 40. By the way, if it is not possible to negotiate the price, do suppliers tend to agree to put the sample cost on top of the first official trial order instead of the sample order, so I just have to pay for the freight cost only. Have you had this kind of negotiation?\nI will also request for shipment to use China Post Standard Service. Hopefully they would agree with the terms.\nI have to agree that T/T is risky, the method of splitting to 30% down payment and paying the rest upon shipment could at least reduce risk, marginally though. Paypal won't be feasible for bulk orders as well. I know that you are endorsing using Escrow, I'm not familiar with it yet and uncertain if it is supported in my country. As for its mechanics, I hope to ask you privately, if you mind.\nThanks again, Walter!

My first job after college was with a big shipping company. Eleven years after I started that first business in 1967 I began exporting my products to Asia/Pacific countries including China which I have visited on countless occasions.\n\nAfter selling that business in 1987 I began importing from countries including China, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Brazil.

They might have a less efficient order handling process than most, so you should make allowance for that possibility.\n\nBecause they have the most desirable product, it would be worth being a little conciliatory now. I suggest that you tell them that you understand that they can't quote for freight at this time, but you would like to have your freight forwarder quote for you.  To do that you need to ask them for shipping package dimension, and weights, and also number of packages.\n\nYou can then ask several freight forwarders to quote in writing on a door to door basis, including customs clearance costs. The only extra charge should be duty and taxes if applicable.\n\nDepending on shipment size it can be a good idea to leave the door open for the forwarders to quote both air freight and sea freight. Air freight can sometimes be cheaper than sea freight if the forwarder consolidates the shipment. This is often done if you tell them that urgent delivery is not essential.\n\nWalter", "Hi Walter,\n\nI want to thank you for taking the time to put together this amazing thread.

I think they will be safe since the report looks very legit. \nA few questions are left regarding the report, I hope you dont mind me asking:\n1) In the CE and RoHs report are many modell numbers but only photos of one device included. My supplier stated that they only need to test the feature richest device to get the CE-certification. Is this true?\n\n2) I checked the CE certification for another device from the manufacturer and it was legit. Now the site of the testing institute is offline since 1-2 weeks. Should I be worried?\n\n3) The supplier sent me a ce-certification and a ce-report for one device. The problem is, that the ce-certification is issued by \"UDEM International Certification Auditing training centre industry and trade co.ltd\" (http://udemltd.com.tr/) the report tho is issued by \"Shenzhen BCTC Technology Co.,Ltd\" (bctc-lab.com) --> website is offline.\nI checked the UDEM certificate and even wrote them a mail and it is genuine. \nWhy do they have a report from another testing company?

A forwarder will include any charges such as cost involved in loading and unload the goods into and out of a container. The forwarder will not charge your supplier any LCL charge, they would simply include that in your quote.\n\nThe supplier might have added this LCL amount as a cost penalty for ordering less than a container load. It is common for suppliers to impose an extra charge for orders below their MOQ, but I have never seen it referred to as an LCL charge.\n\nI suspect that your supplier is being opportunist. If you are to proceed with the order, you should get your forwarder to write to you and cc the supplier stating that they will not charge the supplier any LCL or other charges.\n\nWalter", "WOW.

Couriers would pass my incoming shipments to a small local carrier in the nearest big town, and they would be delivered to me the next day. When I wanted to send shipments I would go to the nearby small airstrip where a courier aircraft picked up documents from the bank, legal papers from the local lawyer, and small packages from small businesses. They were then flown to a large transshipment center where they were forwarded on. They were delivered right across the country in 24 - 48 hours. At least I had the benefit of daily flights (5 days per week) that you might not have in your location. \n\nAsk around the island. Find out how the postal service gets their parcels. How does the local shop get their supplies? If they come by small ship, it might mean a week or two between deliveries, but you will have to adjust your system to suit.

That is not good policy, because viewing a price list could encourage buyers to choose products they had not otherwise intended to buy, but it is not a red flag.\n\nCatalogs will often be quite general in their nature, sometimes showing products that have only been made as prototypes. For that reason they consider those products to be custom made. The products illustrated might not even  have reached the prototype stage yet. To illustrate, let me tell you about restaurants in Japan.\n\nOn entering restaurants in Tokyo I have seen plates of food displayed so that customers will know exactly what the meals will look like when they are served up to you. BUT..... Those plates of food are not food, they are wax. Without cutting into those displayed meals it would be impossible to tell that they are made of wax. \n\nFull size design models of cars are still produced in clay, and they look precisely like the real vehicle that will subsequently be made of steel and plastic.\n\nIf you choose one product and request a quote, they will tell you the price, even if they have never before done a production run of that product.\n\nWalter", "eticket said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nWalter:\n\nI'm afraid I have another question.

An audit can take many forms, including a company report that confirms registration with the Chinese authorities, paid up capital, production capacity, years established, confirmation of all contact details including directors, and verification of authenticity of certificates. Cost will be around the same as you would pay for a QC check.\n\nVerifying the supplier's status as a genuine manufacturer can usually be done without paying for an audit.\n\nOther audits could cover quality inspections during production, after production, or before shipping.  I would consider the last one to be the most important, because it can and should include not only quality but also checking that packaging is adequate to avoid damage in shipping.\n\nFor large orders, inspections at an early stage during production can avoid possible delays if the quality is unsatisfactory. Faults and deficiencies can be detected and remedied before the entire production run is manufactured.\n\nI should inform you and other readers that in the many years that I was importing I never had a quality inspection done. Before choosing a supplier I always visited their factory. I developed a rapport with the supplier and examined the various qualities they made, making it clear which quality I wanted.\n\n Occasionally there were faulty products supplied, but having negotiated a monthly account arrangement (see Ch 15.1) on the basis of several repeat orders each month, I always received the goods before having to pay. This gave me a big advantage in quality control, but I used that advantage judiciously, proving that I was fair and reasonable, with the result that I never even had to return any faulty goods.\n\nNot all importers will be in a position to operate that way, in which case the best procedure is to develop a good relationship with your supplier. Nothing, including quality inspection services, can beat that. Until that relationship is established you might have to choose between gambling on whether or not you have made the right assessment of the supplier, or paying for an inspection service to do QC for you.\n\nWalter", "Walter:\n\nFirst, thank you for your EXCELLENT discussion on inspections!\n\nNext, in my initial contact with a company, I'm discovering I need to make it clear I want a company audit report bec companies insist on sending me product test reports of the product in which I initially expressed interest (sigh).\n\nIn Ch. 28, I don't suppose you forgot to list the China Quality Certification Centre?

If I understand it correctly, the email amounts to a declaration that unless vendors sign up as a Gold Supplier, the only way they can respond to buyer inquiries is if the buyer goes to the vendor's website and emails to their contact address found there.\n\nHere's part of the email I received:\n\"Important Update to Inquiry Policy\nOnly Gold Suppliers* can reply to inquires beginning in 2016 January!\n\nDear Respectable Walter, \n\nIn order to improve buyers' experience and provide better services to our customers, Alibaba decides to reserve the inquiry reply function to Gold Supplier Members* starting from 2016 January. \"\n\nAs I read this it means that no verified or unverified advertisers will be permitted to reply to your inquiries. In reality that doesn't make much difference, because the only checking that is done in order to be verified is to confirm that the business actually exists.\n\nSo you must deal only with Gold Suppliers, but the only checking that is done in order to be a Gold Supplier is to confirm that the business actually exists. Nothing more.\n\nWhy would Alibaba make it virtually impossible for non-gold members to sell? The answer is simple: $$$$$$$$$. The annual fee to become a basic Gold Supplier has now increased from $699 to $1,899. For greater privileges that put a supplier's advertising higher in the listings the fee gets as high as $6,499 per year. The scheme is certainly working. I did a search for a popular product and found 2346 Suppliers listed. Every single one of them was a Gold Supplier. Previous searches found many that weren't.\n\nIn the same email, they offered this encouragement:\n\"Let\u2019s Expand Your Business.\nStart by upgrading to a Gold Supplier Membership\nAuthentication and Verification helps you gain immediate trust from buyers.\" My bolding.\n\nI have written before about the inherent risks in dealing with suppliers on Alibaba, but many still believe that if they only deal with Gold Suppliers all will be well. Is a Gold Supplier really any better than any others? Clearly that is not the case. Here is a cut and paste from their website's resources section:\n\n\"Are all Gold Suppliers trustworthy? \nThrough the completion of the verification process, Alibaba.com can only check whether the business is registered in its local business administration region. This verification does not verify the integrity of the business\"  As the words I have bolded show, that verification process only confirms that the business exists. \n\nJust in passing, a note about length of time as a Gold Supplier. On numerous occasions, when checking out a supplier on behalf of my book users, I have found businesses whose year of establishment was much later than the year they supposedly became Gold Suppliers. Here is a recent example: Business established 2015, Gold Supplier since 2012.

This can leave you out in the cold, sometimes with a lot of unsold stock. If you sell B2B and sell under their brand name that makes it easier for them to locate your customers and push you out. Your best protection is to register that brand for yourself. Make sure you check to see if their brand is registered in Australia before you make any agreement.\nTo sell a large quantity of product in one go, make a killing and move on to the next \"exclusive\" agent. You can't be sure they will do what they promise. Your best protection is to limit the initial stock purchase to a comfortable value regardless of how much they might protest.\nAre the promotional products free to you? If not, you might be able to buy them direct from the manufacturer of those products.\n\nYou do need to convince them that you are capable of doing what they want you to do. The deal looks good on the surface, but you need to consider the full picture.\n\n\nSelling B2B looks attractive, but capital requirements can be substantial. Retailers have a tendency to expect their wholesale suppliers to act as their bankers, providing credit, sometimes for extended periods. You may have to outlay a lot of money for your next shipment before you are paid for the first.\nThe lower margins increase your risk. Retailers usually expect to mark up the products by 100%, so work out what your selling price has to be to give returns that covers all costs and leave you with a decent margin.\nBusiness failures in retail are very common, in which case you might never be paid. A big prospect might be sailing close to the wind when they place the first order and go into liquidation soon after receiving your goods. Worse still, it might be a repeat order and they haven't yet paid for the first one!\nIf all goes well and sales continue to grow, so does your capital requirement. Can you finance that out of profits, or will you need to borrow and incur extra costs doing that? Growth without capital backing is one of the major causes of new business failure.\nSorry to seem negative, but you asked about possible pitfalls.\n\nWalter", "Hey Walter,\n\nI was curious on your thoughts about Cargo Insurance for shipping via boat.\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but is it true that all liability for cargo and the boat is split between all customers using the service?

If I had not been a frequent visitor to China as an exporter, I would have had difficulty locating good suppliers before the advent of the internet. While in China, I made good use of the local Yellow Pages. \n\nThis led me to finding one of the only two manufacturers of a product I was reluctantly buying from a wholesaler. His little factory was located on a hillside outside a small village. He met me in dirty overalls, because he operated some of the machinery himself, but over several cups of Jasmine tea, we negotiated a good deal and he became one of my regular suppliers. He still does not advertise online!\n\nThe anonymity of the internet has spawned a large number of scammers, who can hide their true identity and location. In some countries that can still be done using mobile phones, but when only landlines were available, tracking down criminals was a bit easier.\n\nThe big benefits of the internet are: 1. For manufacturers and wholesalers: Access to international advertising for nothing, or for relatively small fees.\n                                                        2. For resellers: Easy access to sources. Easy access to consumers to sell to.\n\nThe transition of low cost labor from country to country did begin as you say with Japan. Post WW2 Japan was helped in building up an industrial economy, and labor costs were very low. The result was low cost and mainly low quality products. Japan quickly went on to improve living standards and product quality, with the result that buyers looking for cheap and nasty products turned to South Korea.\n\nThe process was repeated with Taiwan next in line, then British controlled Hong Kong took on the role of the world's supplier of cheap goods, until mainland China joined them.\n\nNow it is more of a free-for-all, with low labor cost countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America all wanting a share of the pie. I see this trend continuing with  Eastern European countries joining in. India still has a lot to learn before they will get their share as exporters.\n\nThese latest developments are mainly what have prompted me to expand my book's treatment of sourcing from countries other than China. China will still play a big role for some years yet, but importers wanting to be a jump ahead of their competitors will need to include other countries in their sourcing programs.\n\nWalter", "Hey Walter, thank you so much for creating this thread!

I have sent off some quick replies and hope to answer all over the next couple of days. \n\nWalter", "QUESTION REGARDING EXW QUOTES.\n\nThis recent question via PM and my answer could be of value to others, so I am posting it here. It includes a follow up Q & A.\n\nQ. Should I be cautious when accepting an EXW quote from a Chinese supplier? I am not sure I fully understand the definition of the term. I found a supplier that offers a really good price for the product I wish to import, however they are quoting an EXW price. What do you recommend, should I avoid this one and just stick with FOB quotes?\n\nIn regards to my prior question, are suppliers willing to change terms on the quotes they provide (for example... from EXW to FOB Shenzhen) if I were to request it?\n\nA.  I would never accept an EXW quote unless I was arranging freight door to door through my freight forwarder. The supplier could even refuse to help with loading the shipment on a truck. FOB is usually for shipments loaded at a certain point. It could be a sea port, an airport, a warehouse in China, or even your carrier's vehicle at the supplier's loading dock. Wherever it applies that must be stated as part of the terms.\n\nMany Chinese suppliers quote FOB without stating where. In that case they probably mean EXW, so always be sure to get them to state the point of loading. Never accept a quote that simply says FOB.\n\nExamples:\n\nFOB Shenzhen means loaded on board the vessel at the port of Shenzhen.\nFOB Factory means loaded on your carrier's transport at the supplier's factory. The carrier could be taking the goods to a sea port, or an airport, or the carrier might be a courier.\nFOB Beijing airport means delivered to the air transport company at the airport.\nFollow up Q. In regards to my prior question, are suppliers willing to change terms on the quotes they provide (for example... from EXW to FOB Shenzhen) if I were to request it? \nA. You are the customer, and if they want your business they should agree to any reasonable request.\n\nChanging from EXW to FOB Shenzhen is very reasonable.\n\nWalter", "Hi Walter,\n\nI've done a lot of air shipments but will be moving to sea freight with some new products.\n\nShould I have the supplier quote the freight to the US, or would it be better to get my own forwarder/customs agent?

Once it all becomes routine to you, that is when you could possibly save some money by handling clearance processes and other matters yourself.\n\nIt is also the reason I publish revisions of my book.

So I figured I'd go ahead and complete the form and have them handle the customs entry on my behalf.

A BL is a negotiable document like a check, but an AWB is not negotiable.\n\nIn answer to your questions:\n1.     You can do an informal entry even though you have completed the Power of Attorney (POA) document and even if you do lodge a single entry bond. A bond is not required for shipments under $2,500, but if you don't have one your forwarder might not deliver until you pay any duty and taxes due. If you have obtained a bond they will expedite delivery and you have 10 days to pay any duty and tax. Because of the risk of delay, I would obtain a bond. A single entry bond is provided by insurers who usually specialize in that field. The bond guarantees payment.\n        A single entry bond at a minimum of about $30 to $40 (or $4 to $6 per $1,000) is suitable if you only import one or two shipments in a year, but for more, you will usually find a continuous bond better value at about $400 to $600 per year depending on the insurer you choose.\n        I would strongly advise getting your forwarder to arrange clearance, which involves lodging the informal entry and payment of duty and taxes on your behalf - at least for the first shipment.\n2.    The choice between formal and informal entries is not dependent on you unless you are a masochist. It is determined by legislation. Currently that allows an informal entry for shipments under $2,500 and you would be crazy to choose a formal entry when it is not required. Although an informal entry is simpler than a formal one, you will still suffer delays if you make one small mistake in completing the informal entry.\n        If you have asked your forwarder to handle the clearance they will do it without any need to contact you unless there is some information or documentation missing. Minimum documentation required will be AWB, Commercial Invoice, and Packing Slip.\n        You can obtain your bond through insurance brokers.\n3.     Your forwarder should advise you when the goods arrive in the US. Delivery will be automatic if you have a bond, but may be a few more days if you don't. (See A1 above)\n4.

The larger quantity spreads the cost of freight.\n\nIf you have time to allow for the sampling process, it probably pays to only order samples from one supplier that you have thoroughly checked out. Otherwise you could spend a huge amount on samples, particularly if there are multiple vendors of the same product, because they will probably all come from the one factory. If you need to move quickly you will have to accept a higher cost for your samples.\n\nIt does seem though that the ones you are dealing with are wanting to make a big profit on selling the samples. Air courier costs are high, but $150 to $175 for freight may well be excessive, or else they are excessively loading the unit price for a few samples.\n\nI think you might find some help in the post I made on this subject here: Order sample from multiple suppliers?\n\nDon't forget to ask if they will deduct the sample cost from your first order.\n\nWalter", "Walter, I wanted to begin by thanking your for this quite educational thread.

It helps me with my reply.\n\nUnlike many who start off and fail in this industry, you are starting off on the right foot by being prepared to learn what needs to be learned. \n\nAny insight my book offers about choosing a product is almost certainly insufficient for your needs. There are others far better qualified than I am to provide help in that regard. You will find a lot of helpful information in threads by  @Vigilante @AgainstAllOdds, and @biophase to name a few. \n\nThere are also some genuine courses available that provide good advice. There are also a huge number that just recycle old information, and some of those even dare charge ridiculously high prices. You need to do some research into that also.\n\nI was fortunate in finding a B2B niche in a field that interested me (chemicals), but while visiting China while exporting chemicals I was bombarded with requests to act as an import agent for a huge variety of products. I maintained a \"good ideas\" file in which I kept information on a select few of those, and after selling the exporting business I chose one of those good ideas. I had actually worked in the manufacturing part of that industry during school vacations, and I also had relatives who knew something about the use of the products that I was then thinking of importing.\n\nI wrote the preceding paragraph to show that I did not look for a niche, but instead I saw an ordinary everyday product category that was widely used but poorly served by current suppliers, and I was confident that I could outsell them. The products were in use in almost every sector of industry and commerce and every day every person would see these products in use, but by and large what little effort was made by suppliers to advertise involved trying to sell the product rather than selling themselves. I hope that helps.\n\nRegarding having Chinese speaking relatives, that can put you at a great advantage. I don't deal with that in my book, but I will be happy to give you some ideas once you get started. Hong Kong based friends would probably need education on how to source products, even though they are well located. \n\nWalter", "Walter Hay said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nHey ddzc,\n1. If you know what products are a specialty in certain countries, you will then need to find a B2B site relevant to that country, but if you just want to browse while looking for ideas, you will need to search websites for any country that has an export industry. Some of the sites that I recommend are annoying and not easy to use, particularly if you are just browsing, but once you take the time you can find some real gems in the form of unique products that are not already being sold in the US or, UK etc.\n\nWhen browsing, it is best to start searching in product areas that are of interest to you, even if you may not have previously intended selling such products. At the same time you should keep your eyes open for other product categories that just might be worth looking through.\n\n2. The sites you mention above do have some international businesses (including US companies) offering products, but they mostly have suppliers listed from China. There is another very big source that I have used extensively in the past, but I simply can't disclose online because my contacts there would not appreciate an huge influx of inquiries from newbies. It is a source that is generally only known to the big boys in importing and it was for a long time my main sourcing site. Of all the user unfriendly sites that I have encountered this one is the worst, and working your way through it is tedious, and will lead to many dead ends. I give step by step instructions in my book on how to use it, but I know that very few of my book readers actually persevere with it because it is so slow to get results.\n\n3. A major stumbling block to getting high profit margins via Alibaba is that the vast majority of advertisers falsely claim to be manufacturers but are in fact traders or wholesalers. They add their margin to the manufacturer's price before they quote you, so away goes at least 25% of the possible margin. If you deal with real manufacturers you will get the best price, and I advise against haggling to get that best price.\n\nThe landed price I always worked on included door to door courier delivery or EMS. There were many times when the margins were way above cost X 250%. One of my franchisees once wrote to me (letter on file) \"....it is nice to make that occasional $50,000 profit for 1/2 day's work.\" His landed cost on one such order was around $7,500, and his selling price to the single customer was just under $60,000. I can quote him because I can prove it to the FTC, but I can't quote my own figures without opening up my tax returns from my business that I sold a few years ago.\n\nThe main tactics are:\n\nFind a product that is not already being sold in your country. You may need to look past the big advertisers and look for the small businesses. Or you may need to look in places other than China.\n\nCommunicate slowly, slowly, with a small manufacturer until you build a rapport.\nRemember that you are an unknown quantity to them, just as they are to you. Build trust.\n\nAvoid allowing price to be the main point of discussion in the early stages.\nDon't ask MOQ. Wait until they tell you. Then request a quote on that quantity.\nTell them you would like to place a trial order for x amount. (X = MOQ \u00f7 5 or 10) and request quote. Single samples may be necessary first if the unit price is high.\n\nClick to expand...\n\nHey Walter,\ni am slowly going trough your thread and writing everything important out.

Few people bother reading the fine print, but I am one of the few that do. I can tell you that the fine print contains contradictions and is missing information that is very important to buyers.\n\nThe biggest problem is the time limit. If you are lucky enough to find a real manufacturer on Alibaba you might think you are protected, but remember to read Alibaba's fine print regarding their Secure Payment service. It has a short time limit for you to lodge a dispute and many suppliers are expert at procrastinating until that time limit runs out.\n\nThe way some suppliers work the system is to respond positively and appear to be very helpful when you make a complaint. They procrastinate, all the while giving you the impression that they will give you a refund. When you finally tire of the delays and the confusion, you escalate the dispute.\n\nThat is when you find that you have passed the deadline and Alibaba won't accept your claim.\n\nThere are other problems, such as the risk of refusal of your claim if you sign for a parcel and it contains wood shavings, newspaper, or maybe an empty plastic casing instead of the phone you ordered.\n\nDon't forget the huge cost of returning any faulty product. Suppliers on Alibaba will invariably require that before they will issue a refund. That is one of the many ways they manage to avoid refunding money.\n\nIf they will accept escrow.com that is about as safe as you can get, but those who will accept it will usually only do so if you pay the fees. If the value is high enough use an L/C. It is very difficult for suppliers to defraud you if you pay that way. It can be done, but is usually only done on very big value shipments.\n\nWalter", "Hey Walter,\n\nI'm currently looking at a few manufacturers for a type of product I'm interested in importing.\n\nI've checked the assessment records and many of the companies I looked at have the box checked \"manufacturer and trade company.\" This may sound like a stupid question but is that something to stay away from?

It's false economy IMO because with less information, buyers are less likely to contact them.\n\nMany factories are leased.

As a general rule, all suppliers want more customers. In a way though, buyers are often competing for manufacturers to serve them, but primarily in the way they are perceived by the supplier. This is why that first contact is so important. If you come across as a novice, they will often be inclined to either not bother with your inquiry, or else they will try to take advantage of you. If you haven't already, I suggest you start again and use the first contact email format in my book. The same format with small modifications can be used for inquiries through B2B sites. If you have used my format, maybe you would like to send a copy to me via PM for critical comment.\n2. It is unusual for suppliers to do much by way of research on prospective customers. If they can look at your website and find out what products you are handling, and your selling prices, they will certainly do that. I would prefer to not disclose my website information, because that can be like telling a car salesman how much you are willing to spend.\n3. It helps if you show that you know something about their company and their products. Think like a seller, not like a buyer. Put yourself in tyheir position, knowing that they receive a huge volume of inquiries. That will help you avoid asking questions that they would see as pointless or just as fluff.\n\nWalter", "Walter,\nI have been reading a lot of your posts and I got interest in buying your book and read it before my first importing experience.

If you look at Chapter 4 in my book you will see the difference between the various freight methods. Air courier is not the same as air freight, and sea freight is usually only suitable for large shipments, but there are a lot of variables. \n\nThis is where a freight forwarder can help you by arranging the most cost effective freight method. Depending on the weight and volume, it might pay you to get your local freight forwarder to handle the entire process. Be sure their quote is for delivery to your door including all charges. You will still have to pay duty and any taxes charged.\n\n1.You are the customer, so you can request different shipping, but there is no guarantee they will agree. Some suppliers find it very inconvenient to use China Post and will only use couriers for small shipments because the courier picks up directly from their factory. There is no harm in asking for EMS, which is always prepaid.\n\n2. FedEx in China don't cover the whole country and many smaller cities are not served by them. A Remote Pickup would relate to a pick up from one of those cities.  It would be better to ask your supplier to quote you for delivery by courier door to door. They might have an account with FedEx, but it could be UPS or others. FedEx have an agency arrangement with a large Chinese Freight company who will pick up from any place in China, but if you arrange this direct with FedEx an RPI will cost you a lot extra. If your supplier deals direct with the FedEx agent, which most of them do, you will save about 50%. The same applies with UPS, DHL, etc.\n\nWalter", "SeaForFreedom said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nHi! I see you're talking about importing, but do you do any exporting? Particularly to China or the US.\n\nWould you think China is a good place to export to? I'm planning to do an export business.Click to expand...\n\nBefore you start exporting, you need to understand importing. This will make it possible for you to know what your customers will require when you ship the goods to them.\n\nI have received numerous requests for help since a well known internet marketer published a guide about 5 or 6 years ago on how to make big money by acting as an export agent. Although the concept is a good one, I didn't like that guide because it made it look too easy.\n\nI previously owned a business that exported to countries in the Asia/Pacific region, and when I sold that business I started importing. I can tell you that although big deals are possible when you act as an export agent, it is not any easy road to the fastlane.\n\nThe difficulty is not in the process of exporting, but in finding businesses that will take any notice of you when you offer to sell for them. Finding overseas buyers is an easier process.\n\nIt is important to realize that you need to understand not only the various shipping terms, commonly known as Incoterms, but the actual logistical process of moving the goods once you have sold them. You must also know the jargon relevant to the particular industry or product category you are trying to sell. In some cases you will have to learn technical stuff about the product. International financial transactions is another area to learn.\n\nChina is a large importer of commodities, finished and semi-finished goods, specialized products and consumer products. Before trying to export to China you must know the tariff rules and rates.\n\nYou have started on a potentially highly profitable road, but you must learn the road rules before you start driving. I learned those rules many years ago and have had to update that knowledge quite often. I have been asked to write a book on the subject but I am not keen to do so because I know how high the failure rate is compared to importing.\n\nWalter", "QUESTION ABOUT NON-VERIFIED SUPPLIERS\n\nI was recently asked a question by a Fastlane member about the advisability of dealing with unverified suppliers and I thought posting on the subject could be of benefit to others.\n\nFirst you should think about why a supplier is not verified. The most common reasons would be that:\n\nThey are small, or..... \n\nA new business, \n\nNew to exporting, \n\nJust testing the waters, \n\nOr even scammers who don't want to spend money on any part of the verification process.\nThe last possibility is the scariest, but the least likely by far. After all, if someone wants to cheat people of their hard earned money, the most important thing for them to do is to make themselves look reputable. The big B2B sites sell their listing services to all and sundry, and in the process they push the idea of looking trustworthy.\n\nListing fees and status badges are huge money earners for the B2B sites for the simple reason that they have convinced sellers that they need those status badges if they are to make sales, and they have convinced the buyers that suppliers displaying those badges are the best ones to deal with.\n\nIf you are considering buying from an unverified advertiser or one without any status badges, you must tread warily. Do a Google search, and don't stop at Page 1, or 2, or 3 etc..... If there are bad reviews they could well be found on later pages. Use variations on their business name. Use the full name, but also try leaving out the part of the name that relates to their location. If you do decide to buy from such businesses, be sure to place only a small order first time round.\n\nKnowing that chances are small that they are scammers just because of their free listing, you might now decide to look at them because they are: small, new, new to exporting, or just testing the waters.\n\nWho knows, you might be their first export customer. You might be the first buyer to import their product. I suggest this is worth considering.\n\nWalter", "The benefits of thinking outside the box.\n\nI will give two examples of how I made a killing by thinking outside the box. Both related to my importing business, but please note that these were B2B sales.\n\n\nA government authority contacted me to see if I could make an unusual product. It was related to a very common type of product that I and many competitors were selling for less than $2.00 on orders of 1,000 pcs. They had contacted every business advertising in the Yellow Pages, and none were willing to do what they wanted.                           I knew that the manufacturers from whom I was buying would not make such a product because their equipment was unsuitable. so I searched and found a small engineering company in China. I provided drawings, accepted their quote and landed 1000 pcs at a total cost of $3,000, having already obtained an official order for 1,000 pcs for $21,000.  A handy profit for very little work, just because I was willing to think outside the box.\nAn entrepreneur had an idea for making an every day product seem better quality. It was not  a cosmetic change, just a way of adding a better feel to the product. He knew that many of the products I was selling were manufactured using a process that would suit his product, but he had no idea where to find manufacturers. I knew, and quoted him $2.20 each for the 100,000 pcs initial order.                  The product was nothing like anything in my product range, but with a landed cost of 19c each, I did very nicely. Again, this was a result of deciding to make a product in China, even though it was way outside my industry sector.\nI should point out that the second customer had also thought outside the box. Frustrated at being unable to find manufacturers for that type of product he thought were there any products on the market that must be made the same way. That's how he found my business.\n\nJust as an aside, these two stories highlight the fact that cost plus pricing would not have gained me the big profits I made by charging what I thought the market could bear.\n\nWalter", "Hi Walter,\n\nI have a question.

This will make it possible for you to know what your customers will require when you ship the goods to them.\n\nI have received numerous requests for help since a well known internet marketer published a guide about 5 or 6 years ago on how to make big money by acting as an export agent. Although the concept is a good one, I didn't like that guide because it made it look too easy.\n\nI previously owned a business that exported to countries in the Asia/Pacific region, and when I sold that business I started importing. I can tell you that although big deals are possible when you act as an export agent, it is not any easy road to the fastlane.\n\nThe difficulty is not in the process of exporting, but in finding businesses that will take any notice of you when you offer to sell for them. Finding overseas buyers is an easier process.\n\nIt is important to realize that you need to understand not only the various shipping terms, commonly known as Incoterms, but the actual logistical process of moving the goods once you have sold them. You must also know the jargon relevant to the particular industry or product category you are trying to sell. In some cases you will have to learn technical stuff about the product. International financial transactions is another area to learn.\n\nChina is a large importer of commodities, finished and semi-finished goods, specialized products and consumer products. Before trying to export to China you must know the tariff rules and rates.\n\nYou have started on a potentially highly profitable road, but you must learn the road rules before you start driving. I learned those rules many years ago and have had to update that knowledge quite often. I have been asked to write a book on the subject but I am not keen to do so because I know how high the failure rate is compared to importing.\n\nWalterClick to expand...\n\n\nSorry for the late reply and thanks for the answer!

Do you publish, freely or commercially, anything that could offer more insight on both import and export business? I would love to learn those \"rules\" about exporting and importing.Click to expand...\n\nI haven't written anything specific to exporting, but as I wrote previously, if you want to export, you will need to understand importing.\n\nThe technical jargon is the same. The commercial information such as payment methods is the same. The shipping processes are the same. Compliance with regulations is also the same.\n\nAs a supplier (exporter) you need to know what Incoterms to use, what payment methods and terms to offer, and how to arrange shipping. You will also need to know what documentation to provide. All of this is covered in my book on importing, but from the opposite side. You can find my book here: http://www.provenchinasourcing.com\n\nWhat I don't deal with because it is export specific is information on such things as packing containers, organizing freight from your supplier's premises to the shipping point, loading on board, and prepare shipping documents, but I would just make two comments in that regard:\n1. The owner of the goods might have the capability to pack containers and freight to the shipping point, but that should be part of your service for which you will obtain a commission.\n2. Freight forwarders, about whom I write quite a lot in my book, would be able to handle all those things.\n\nWalter", "I continue to receive questions about importing big brand products. I have written specifically on ways it is possible to do this legally in the US, but that only applies to exceptions not to any brand any time. See my post on the subject of Parallel Importing here: Sharing my lifetime experience in export/import. Product sourcing specialist.\n\nThis question came to me a couple of days ago from a person who has been selling brand name toys. I am posting the full story because of the fact that this person has previously imported what were undoubtedly illegal goods, thinking it was legitimate, then moved on to buying from a licensed US distributor, but now wants to revert to buying from China. He/she clearly knows that it is risky, but wants me to give the OK.\n\n\"I sell toys on Amazon through FBA, and right now, I feel I am seriously over-paying my supplier which is based in USA.\n\nPractically 100% of all the toys I sell are made in China. In particular, I buy a lot of the following brands: Mattel, Hasbro, Disney, Funko.\n\nI know Chinese retailers who can give me a good price for the items. The problem is that their invoices are not accepted by Amazon as proof of authenticity. I should mention that I have worked with some of these China retailers for years on toy ventures on non-Amazon sites, so I know their goods are legit. Naturally, none of them will reveal their supply source.\n\nI wonder if you know if there are companies or a company that I can work with in China to purchase licensed Hasbro, Mattel, Disney and Funko brand items? I'm located in Singapore. As long as we have the legal paperwork proving the authenticity of the items we are importing, there will be no issues.\"\n\n\nHere is my reply: \"I am sorry to tell you that there is no way you can safely buy brand name toys from China.\n\nMany people like you get away with selling those toys for a while, but sooner or later they get caught. Even some of the suppliers in China are prosecuted because the Chinese government is trying to improve their protection of Intellectual Property rights.\n\nFor importers such as you, the risks are much greater. Chances are the goods will be seized by Customs, and your name and address flagged so that all your shipments will be delayed for thorough inspection.\n\nThe retailers you see in China have usually purchased the goods at very low prices in Hong Kong, where there is little control.\n\nThe difficulty arises from the fact that the manufacturers have a contract that only allows them to supply the brand owner or licensees of the brand owner and those licenses are usually restricted to one geographic location, so you can't possibly get genuine paperwork to prove the authenticity.\n\nI know of many manufacturers who cheat the system, which is a foolish thing to do, because they have million dollar orders from the brand owner, and they risk losing that to make an illegal $20,000 sale.\n\nYou would find it impossible to obtain verifiable documents proving authenticity. Unfortunately such documents are often forged and if your Customs people check properly they will find that to be the case.\"\n\nWalter", "I've been looking at getting into Amazon FBA, has anybody here had experience using 'Jungle Scout'?\nIt is a chrome plugin that gives you estimated sales, estimated revenue etc from amazon listings.

In that case they would tell their supplier the matter was urgent, and then burn the candle at both ends in order to check replies as soon as they came in.\n\nStarting with \u00a3500 is going to mean slower progress, but I had one of my book users email me to say: \"Ok.

As for me expending so much time and effort now in my retirement, I assure you I am enjoying every minute of it. Earlier today I received a thank you PM from a member who I have been helping in his struggle through a difficult sourcing problem for quite a long time. Everything has fallen into place, and he is now making great progress. That sort of message makes it all worthwhile.\n\nRegarding your questions:\n\nGovernment Orders: I always preferred to look for smaller government contracts that were available outside the tender process. They were much more personal, and it was possible to present a case for my company that simply can't be done in many tender situations.\n\nThe other big benefit was that I didn't have to put up with not being a big player insider with lobbyists and others with influence to help me. I found that when tendering I was constantly being undercut on price, sometimes by just 1/2 cent per item. Strange how my competitors knew how much to bid! On one occasion I tested the system by bidding a price equal to my cost. A competitor got the order for - you guessed it - 1/2 cent less than my dramatically reduced price.\n\nMany of my franchisees, seeing dollar signs in those big orders, persisted in pursuing them against my advice. They failed to get orders.\n\nCurrency. I did use the relative value of currencies in different countries to help me choose where to buy. The difficulty there is that in most low cost countries, suppliers will quote you in US$. Countries such as Australia, the UK, EU countries, tend to quote in their own currency and that is where you can do well. I found certain products manufactured in Australia that I could import into the UK at a huge margin. If I wanted to I could even buy retail in Australia and double my money in the UK. By the way, it is also possible to buy retail in China at incredibly low prices, and pay in RMB, provided you are willing to shop where the locals shop.\n\nOne way of finding such countries is to use The Economist magazine's  Big Mac Index. If the price of a Big Mac is much lower in one country and suppliers there will quote you in their local currency, you should have a good chance of finding products with good margins. For example, workers in the UK can buy twice as many Big Macs for an hour's wages as workers in Portugal. So if your desired product is made in Portugal and the manufacturer quotes you in Euros, you could do very well. You would find it difficult to get as good a deal by buying that product from a  UK manufacturer.\n\nWalter", "Thanks again @Walter Hay \n\nYour answers never cease to go beyond my expectations.\n\n- Brian", "Hello Walter,\n\nas mentioned earlier, your book is unbelievably great. \n\nI took action.

That is your air courier account number, and it is not needed because the samples will be shipped by post not by air courier. You should just tell them you will be happy for them to use Express Post. If you do that you can ignore their comments about your express (air courier) account.\n\nFor the benefit of all readers I will say that when asked for an air courier account number it is best to tell suppliers that you prefer to have them pre-pay the air courier charge.

Exceptions relate to some other classifications as well as food. Generally, labelling if used, must not be misleading, and if the products are potentially hazardous the hazards should be identified. Labels for clothing and goods intended for children  are regulated, but apart from required certifications such as CE it appears to be your choice.\n\nI can find no requirement for serial numbers, and the UK has long resisted country of origin labelling except for food, and even that is haphazard.\n\nAlthough I can't offer legal advice, but for the UK I suggest that serial numbers are optional as is Made In China labelling.\n\nFor readers in other countries, I should mention that country of origin labelling (note US spelling) is highly regulated in some countries including Canada and the US.\n\nWalter", "Using the information Walter has provided in this thread I have been able to transition my slowlane job into a slightly faster lane job.\n\nUsing what I've learned in this thread - the message templates for overseas supplier were copied nearly identically- I was able to solve a poorly managed supply chain problem for one of our products by sourcing overseas.

If they say they're shipping EMS, I'd take their word for it, just confirm it over email/chat and ask how long it will take. If you want/need it faster, ask them to use DHL/TNT/UPS.\n\nShipping is almost always going to be padded, and unless its a huge difference, again, I wouldn't worry too much. If you're really concerned, find a local DHL agent in China and have all samples sent to them, they will most likely give you a better rate, but even China's padded rate is lower than any discounted rate you can get from here. I've used the line, \"shipping seems a bit high, can you please check it again,\" successfully as well to get it reduced if its a huge difference.\n\nPersonally, I always pay a premium for speed, the faster I can get samples, the faster I can compare different suppliers, make changes, get final samples, place the order, and make money. On one of my recent projects, I spent nearly $1500 on samples. Sure, I could've saved some cash on the shipping, but that's 1-2 decent sales days worth of profits.\n\nAlso, realize that the factory is evaluating how easy/hard it is to work with you, and if they see you as a tire kicker that worries about pennies on the sample costs, they may flag you as a small fry and stop responding.\n\nThat said, when it comes to the large orders, you do want to have all that specified, and try to save as much as possible on all costs, because every penny is magnified over the life of the product, so saving $1/unit will add up to thousands and give you extra margin for advertising, returns, etc.\n\n\nHope this helps.", "Thank you Ronak, very helpful answer.", "Ronak said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nLeast I could do after what I've gained here...\n\nOk everyone, I don't want to gunk up this thread with people's requests, so if you're interested in a FREE copy of Walter's book, PM me by 11pm EST tonight with proof of how you have put stuff you've learned on the forum into action, and I'll pick a winner shortly thereafter.

If there is a risk that it is, maybe you could ask them, or else give it a miss.\n\nIf a product is trademarked, copyrighted, registered design, or patented, it is illegal to import and sell those items. Unfortunately the current trend is to dropship counterfeits of big brand items. One promoter is openly thumbing his nose at the law and selling thousands of copies of his course. He even suggests setting up a website in a jurisdiction that doesn't police Intellectual Property rights.\n\nCurrently a big lawsuit is under way in the US in which hundreds of businesses in the US and other countries are being sued by a big brand owner. Their first step was to shut down the illegal websites, so those businesses now have no business. Further down the line, they will probably seek damages, and that could result in a lot of bankruptcies.\n\nWalter", "OT, but I laugh every time I read Elon's Musk's screen name.", "Walter,\n\nI'm about 30 pages into your book.

These can form the basis of the inspection. If you have set out exactly what you require, a good inspection service will be obliged to check that those specifications have been complied with.\n\nDepending on the product, such specifications can be very complex or very simple. You need to give considerable thought to what it is that you require, not only in production, but also labeling and packaging - both individual packaging and shipping packaging.\n\nIt is very easy to neglect small aspects of quality. A good example is in relation to threads in fabric items. These could be clothing, woven items, embroidered items, soft toys etc. If you don't want loose threads to remain at the cut off location after manufacture, you must state \"All loose threads are to be removed.\" Note: This will cost extra because it is very labor intensive and labor costs money even in China.\n\nIf an item is made of copper, brass, steel, or plastic etc, you might need to specify minimum and maximum thickness. Chinese manufacturers can handle either imperial or metric measurements. Bear in mind that the thickness at a corner will often be greater than at other parts of the product.\n\nIf color is critical, quote Pantone colors, also known as PMS.\n\nThere are a number of inspection services to choose from and I have provided a list here: Sharing my lifetime experience in export/import.

Don't try to export direct to commercial end users. A good agent will have \"cousins\" in business and that can be the start of a good network.\n\nWhen importing from Asia Pacific countries carefully attend to due diligence. Part of the need for this is cultural differences. For example Chinese business people will rarely say no. If they say yes, it could mean maybe, possibly, no, or even yes. Because they sometimes say yes when they should say no, don't be annoyed, just frame your question so that a yes or no answer is not required.\nGet everything in writing.

I have received a parcel from a supplier I found on dhgate and it contains nothing but scrap paper! I had to sign for it before I could open it to check it, so Dhgate say it has been received and they will release payment within 2 days. The rules for disputes are too @#!!X*! complicated and they seem to be changing them when they reply to my complaint because I can\u2019t find the rules they quote on the website. What can I do? This cost me $130.\n\nA. You have seen in my forum posts that I would never recommend DHgate because of the huge number of scams reported, but I am happy to help for your future buying. There are many possible problems with the so-called protection provided by escrow services controlled by the big B2B sites, and you have been caught out by one of them. Because DHgate have told you that because you signed for the parcel, payment will be released to the seller, they will also ask you for proof that the package only contained paper, but any bunny would know that a photo is useless as proof. They will tell you to return the parcel to the supplier, but the supplier will either say they did not receive it, or that it had the goods inside when they sent it.DH gate are only going through the motions until you give up.\n\nIf you paid through PayPal, lodge a dispute with them, but do not say that the goods are not as described, otherwise PayPal will reject your dispute. Tell them that this is a fraud and you signed for an empty package. Depending on which country you are in, contact any government fraud watch body and report this fraud, asking them to contact PayPal and DHgate.com on your behalf. This method has worked for others.\n\nIn future, ask the courier to wait while you open the package. If he/she is a reasonable person they will allow this and you can then refuse to sign for it if it contains paper or other filling instead of the product. I have known people to receive stones, and in one case a brick.\n\nFor the benefit of other readers, I add that you should save a screen shot of the page where you found the product listing, as well as keeping copies of all emails, whether through your own email account or your member\u2019s email on the B2B site. Do this progressively from the beginning of your earliest negotiations to buy, right through to receiving notice of shipment. Save every email even after that point. A number of people report finding all their member emails deleted and that makes it impossible to pursue a dispute claim.\n\nRemember that in almost every case you will be required to return the goods in order to have your claim processed. It is common for suppliers to not take delivery of your parcel, and so they can say you did not return it. That will be another loss to add to what you have already paid.\n\nMake sure you have read the escrow rules, if you can find them. Copy them also.\n\nSOLUTION: In future ask the supplier to accept payment through a reliable service such as escrow.com, telling them you will pay the escrow fees. If they refuse, look for a supplier you can trust, because if they refuse, it could be because they are not trustworthy. You may have to look on websites other than the one where you usually source products.\n\nYou can offer some evidence regarding escrow.com\u2019s high standing:\nIn the US Government\u2019s Strategic Partners List, escrow.com are listed first: http://export.gov/CSPartners/eg_main_051038.asp\neBay will only allow the use of escrow services provided by escrow.com see: http://pages.ebay.com/help/pay/escrow.html\nLicensing of escrow.com by government authorities can be found here: https://www.escrow.com/escrow-101/escrow-licenses.aspxClick to expand...", "Arun Siva said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nSo knowing and establishing common relationship is not only ESsential but vital for those aforementioned nations for me to be able to trade in?

Back in the spring I found the product I was looking for from a sole supplier on Alibaba,  got samples from them, and was off to the races.  The product took off huge, and my second order was once again excellent, but then a week and a half ago I received my third shipment, and learned the hard way that I need to have my shipments professionally inspected instead of me just physically checking the product before shipping to Amazon.  I learned from a couple of customers that my latest shipment had a strong chemical smell.  As this is a baby feeding product, I checked the small supply I had kept on hand, verified it did indeed have a smell, and immediately pulled all inventory from Amazon and notified any customers potentially affected via e-mail.\n\nThankfully I caught it early enough that I believe less than 50 got out to customers, likely significantly less than that, but needless to say it's been an expensive mess.  My agent (who I now believe does not work for an actual manufacturer, but is merely a sourcing agent) said that the shipment must not have been cured for two hours at 225 degrees, which is required for my (silicone) product.  Some testing at home lends credence to his theory.  I quickly placed a replacement order for 2100 units at a very measly discount and arranged for inspection through Topwin.  After talking with Samson at Topwin, he says they have found more and more that agents will switch factories after one or two orders to cut costs and increase their own profits.  This would definitely explain the massive oversight on the last shipment.\n\nIf that is the case, there's no real way to know if the CSPIA lab report he sent me (that I have verified as legitimate) will actually apply to future orders, is there?  If he is indeed using multiple factories, what are the odds that each factory uses the exact same materials?\n\nThe plot has thickened again of late, as his company's Alibaba listing is gone.  There are now several companies on there offering the same products (his was originally the only one), but his is gone.  I'm planning to have Intertek in Illinois certify the incoming shipment (assuming I get it - they've bumped the inspection twice now - first from the 26th to the 28th, and then to the 29th), but how likely is my agent to honor using the same factory from now on if I specify that in the contract?\n\nYour thoughts on the whole fiasco would be greatly appreciated it.  I've got meetings this week with a couple of potential domestic manufacturers.  I realize tooling will require a sizable investment, but after the last two weeks, I'm willing to find the capital.  Selling baby products, and as a father myself, having absolute trust in every stage of the process is critical, and I'm sure prospective liability insurers I am contacting will agree.

I do explain the need to engage a lawyer with experience in international IP, but there is always a risk that your product will be copied regardless.\n\nIt is common for new designs submitted by buyers to appear on the market before the originator of the design even gets a prototype.\n\nIf you intend proceeding I believe you would find my book valuable in relation to the entire process of locating trustworthy, genuine manufacturers, and being sure you cover all the bases.\n\nIn your situation I would probably look for a manufacturer in the US first, but even then it is not always smooth sailing. I know of some US manufacturers who are having the bulk of their products made in China, but they continue to produce one or two products in the US so that they can call themselves manufacturers.   If the company you contact turns out to be in that category, your IP will be at risk unless they have parts manufactured in different Chinese factories and do the assembly in the US.\n\nThat is something you might be able to organize yourself, by using more than one manufacturer with none of them knowing the total design, and you arrange local assembly. \n\nIt is also worth remembering that any new product on the market, wherever it is manufactured, is likely to be copied. Your best chance of success is to have the product made and hit the market, developing a good reputation for your product before copy cats start to undercut your prices.

If he doesn't have one or is reluctant to go to the trouble and expense, you can have it done yourself, or, for the products that I know you intend importing it is even possible to self certify. That is a complex process, but it doesn't necessitate any testing.

The certificate covers the whole product.\n2. Change of shape won't require a new certificate for your products. If you were importing toys that could be an issue in relation to safety.\n3. Most would have a basic knowledge of the requirements. They should all know that they have to obtain the certificate from an accredited body.\n\nCE certification is required for a very wide range of products, not only electrical.

Yes you can import samples without certification. I have sent many samples to Germany and not once, have they ever asked for Certification. But many suppliers may not accept sending that many samples.\n\n2.CE Certification is usually cost between $100 to $5000 USD ( i seen more, depends on electronic). And most likely you need the following CE Certification, ROHS, WEEE and sometimes for some battery devices, you may need some certification for the battery.\n\n3. For shipping you most likely will also need the following CE Declaration of Conformity (letter stating it complies with Euro compliance), MSDS, un38.3 ( for shipping by boat or air for batteries). These may all be additional costs.\n\n\nFor your packing, it sound complicated but its really not.   When they say individual package of 5kg, they mean your carton (your package size). It does not count as a palette. If it counts as a palette, palette would be very small . Also if the package was incorrect, the courier wouldn't accept, which means it would fall under your supplier to fix the issues (you shouldn't be paying for it).", "#nowhere said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nHi Petkovic,\n\nas long as I know that you're a german dude, too, here's the story (you may already know) about another german dude overcoming certification issues...\n\nhttps://www.thefastlaneforum.com/co...first-weeks-100-profit-day.65475/#post-554020\n\nI'm curious what Walter has to say!Click to expand...\n\n\n\n\nAlex H said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nHi\n\nJust stopped by in this thread.

These are my comments to your response:\n\n1.  The supplier uses two different names on their listings: one is the name of the company audited by Bureau Veritas (a trading company according to the report); the other one is the name of the group that apparently encompasses the said trading company, a research center and a factory. Following your advice, I\u2019ve done further research over the weekend and I\u2019ve made some interesting findings. First, I noticed a web address in one of the pictures on the group website. I checked it and it seems to belong to the parent Taiwan-based enterprise. This website includes an ICP number and a link to the website of the supplier. These two companies are obviously interrelated. Second, I have found trade data of the group in Datamyne, Panjiva and ImportGenius. There are several records of shipments to different US companies. As a matter of fact, I have tracked down under which brands these companies are selling the private label product provided by the supplier. It\u2019s good to see that some are currently being sold on Amazon with success, according to the customer reviews.\n\nWhat do you make of this additional information, Walter?\n\n2.  Ok. I\u2019ll do that.\n\n3.  There\u2019s no molding involved. In fact, nothing is built on purpose for me, not even the bottles. The private labelling service includes printing their template bottles and the packaging with my design and brand. I\u2019ll try to negotiate a smaller MOQ using your sample order tactic. With regards to doing the labelling myself, it\u2019s an interesting idea, but I just want to keep things simple for now, so I\u2019d rather let them do all that work for me. Nevertheless, I\u2019ll definitely be interested in reading your book once it is available.\n\n4.  a) The patented products are not chemicals or formulas, but accessories related to the cosmetic product itself. The patent certificates appear in the Bureau Veritas report as authorized. Does this mean that the patents have been granted?\n\nb) This is disheartening, but in the light of the new evidence, this could just be an unnecessary attempt to gild the lily, as you said.

I\u2019ll do that.\n\n3.  There\u2019s no molding involved. In fact, nothing is built on purpose for me, not even the bottles. The private labelling service includes printing their template bottles and the packaging with my design and brand. I\u2019ll try to negotiate a smaller MOQ using your sample order tactic. With regards to doing the labelling myself, it\u2019s an interesting idea, but I just want to keep things simple for now, so I\u2019d rather let them do all that work for me. Nevertheless, I\u2019ll definitely be interested in reading your book once it is available.\n\n4.  a) The patented products are not chemicals or formulas, but accessories related to the cosmetic product itself.

Not all suppliers will do that.\n\nThe cost of $32 each might be for the product only, with freight costing extra. If so, you should consider reducing your per unit cost by ordering multiples.

In any case, they are not doing themselves any favors and I would avoid dealing with them.\n\nAs a matter of interest, it is easier to use Intertek's certificate authentication capability on their website. All you need to do is type in the certificate number, and supplier name. The only problem with that is that certificates might be in a different name because so many Chinese businesses operate under several names. If a different name appears in your search, you would need to see if it is a related company.\n\nDon't worry about an EXW quote. You don't have to accept a quote for shipping terms that don't suit you. Negotiate the terms you want. If you arrange freight through a freight forwarder, you can get the supplier to quote an EXW price provided it includes loading at their factory.

Ignoring a question is a typical Chinese tactic, so they will usually let you get away with it.\n\nAlternatively, you could tell them that your boss wants to test the sample first before deciding on order quantity.\n\nThere's no harm in asking them to quote for door to door on 100 pcs., but I would leave that until the sample arrives. A courier charge of $40 for a sample is not unreasonable, so I would ask them to handle that for you. Depending on your location, some couriers will charge a clearance fee, and that can be painful. Check with a local courier to see if they include the clearance in their door to door charge.

The owner always personally picked me up at the airport and treated me like royalty. The product quality was exceptionally good and service was excellent.\n\nSuddenly it all went pear shaped!\n\nOrders were late. Emails and phone calls resulted in vague stories. Franchisees were getting restless. I caught the first possible flight and this time arrived unannounced.\n\nI was received courteously as usual and later in the day was treated to a grand feast, but on my walk through the factory I could see the cause of the problem. They were flat out producing a massive order for a major international brand. Everything else had to wait. Their prize new customer had placed an order worth millions, and they were only holding orders worth a little under 1/2 million from our franchisees.\n\nI diplomatically applied what little pressure I could exert under the circumstances, and finally told the owner that I would not go home until I could see our orders all being packed. For the rest of that week I went to the factory every day, dined with the owner in the factory's huge dining room and one by one ticked off the orders being prepared for shipment. Under pressure he had put aside one of his production lines for us.\n\nI arranged with my franchisees to cancel the most recent orders that the supplier had not even begun to deal with, and send them to alternative suppliers we had been using for some time. I took time out from my boring days in the office and factory so that I could personally assure those other suppliers that this was just the beginning of a much expanded business relationship with them.\n\nJust imagine the situation if I had not had the foresight to use several suppliers. My business empire would have collapsed overnight.\n\nThe moral of the story - Always be sure you have backup suppliers.\n\nWalter\nP.S. Our former supplier had put all his eggs in one basket, and is no longer in business. It is equally as risky to rely on one customer as it is to rely on one supplier.", "Walter Hay said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nThanks @Roli.

If so, DHL or UPS will handle customs clearance for you, and you should have nothing to do but pay any duty or taxes they pay on your behalf, and the goods will be delivered to you. 6 to 15 days is a bit longer than usual air courier times, although I think they are quoting air courier but just playing it safe regarding delivery time.\n\nSometimes the courier will charge you an additional fee for handling the clearance but it should be included in any door to door service.\n\nIf in the unlikely event that it is actually air freight, as opposed to air courier, yes, you would need to use a freight forwarder, but they should organize everything from point of pickup at your supplier's premises to delivery at your address. Forget DHL or UPS for that. You shouldn't use DHL or UPS for only part of the service, which is what air freight entails. That is because the term \"air freight\" refers to transport airport to airport only, and doesn't include terminal charges, clearance, or delivery to your address.

Nevertheless, I think that if you refuse you will delay shipment unnecessarily. If you get one, I recommend a continuing bond. Let me know if you need help to find a reasonable price.\n\nIf the original quote was DDU, what was the point of delivery specified? If it was the arrivals port, you might be stuck with the extra charges, except for the fact that if it is DDU warehouse at port, that should include Lift Truck charges as well as all port charges. In that case you will still also have to pay trucking to your door. If it was DDU at dock at your port, all of those charges will be added, and in fact such terms would amount to FOB port of destination, not DDU.\n\nIn the case of DDP, that must specify to your door otherwise there will be even more charges such as warehouse fees, truck hire etc. They can't expect duty paid in advance unless they they can tell you exactly what is the HS code and how much the duty is. When the shipment is cleared the rate of duty estimated by the carrier could be a lot less or a lot more than the actual rate levied by Customs, so they are taking a risk, or they are charging at a high duty rate, anticipating a lower real rate and then they will pay the lower rate. I doubt you would see a refund for the difference.\n\nPayment being required prior to shipping is the norm, and that is what they must mean by payment \"once the shipment arrives at the port.\" The question is: Which Port? I am guessing they mean port of loading.\n\nYou might like to play safe by having an inspection company inspect your shipment at time of loading into the container.They will email a report to you, and then you could make the payment. I am assuming LCL quantity, and that makes inspections a bit harder, because the inspection company can't witness the container being sealed unless your cargo is last to go into the container. At least you will know that the cargo has passed QC and has arrived at the port of loading or at the container depot. Without that, you are gambling that the shipment has even left the supplier's premises. It's possible they could inspect it at the supplier's premises and put a seal on the pallet wrapping. You would need to ask the inspection service. Unless it's at the port that would still be a gamble.\n\nShould you choose to have an inspection, you might like to contact a Chinese inspection company that I can now recommend after good reports from Fastlane members, and no bad reports being found in my research. I have arranged a good deal for my book readers and to obtain that, email Samson at safeimport@topwininspection.com. Such an inspection as you need will cost you $197.\n\nWalter", "Such great information here.\n\nIf a Chinese factory claims that they are both a manufacturer and trading company, are they worth talking to?

That is very difficult to assess, but it can often be determined if there is a report published by an independent inspection service such as SGS or TUV. Those reports will usually show illustrations of their production facilities, and in those pictures you can often see the products in various stages of manufacture. \n\nWalter", "Hey Walter, I'm having difficulty convincing these two mfg's to agree to a payment through Escrow.

You could offer to pay their bank fees, but unfortunately few Chinese business people understand real escrow. They can only think of the faux escrow services provided by Alibaba and others.\n\nThe best alternative would be L/C. They might resist that on the grounds of cost also, but I would gently insist. A big benefit of L/C payment is that you can specify all the conditions on the document even to the point of payment due only upon loading at the port (airport) of departure, or until you have confirmed the pickup by the courier, substantiate by your successful tracking of the shipment on the courier's system. In that case the tracking would only need to show that the shipment has actually been collected and is in the courier's system.\n\nIf you want to you can even specify that the goods pass inspection by your inspection service. The supplier has to meet precisely every condition you specify and as soon as they have done that they can negotiate the L/C at their bank. It is advisable to get them to agree to all your conditions before you obtain the L/C at you bank.\n\nWalter", "Hi Walter!\nI hope everything is fine.\n\nToday I recieved a shipment by air from a supplier in China, our product is in a plastic bag with with our logo on.\nI can say that somewhere around 99% of the bags were broken when I recieved the items because of the bags being too small to fit the product.\nIs it something I can do in this situation except for spending hours with superglue? \n\nBy the way thanks alot for all the value provided it has been so much support for someone new in this area.\n\n/Daniel", "@Keithrtay", "Dan1el said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nHi Walter!\nI hope everything is fine.\n\nToday I recieved a shipment by air from a supplier in China, our product is in a plastic bag with with our logo on.\nI can say that somewhere around 99% of the bags were broken when I recieved the items because of the bags being too small to fit the product.\nIs it something I can do in this situation except for spending hours with superglue?\n\nBy the way thanks alot for all the value provided it has been so much support for someone new in this area.\n\n/DanielClick to expand...\n\nUnfortunately you are stuck  with the problem and the only way I see out of it for you is to buy new bags and repack the entire order.

Once I dug into FBA I learned from a lot of the gurus (goo-roos?) but thankfully didn't buy into any of their expensive courses...mostly gleaned information from workshops etc.  I have picked and launched a product prior to reading TFLM and lurking this forum.  It sold out in a couple months and I am currently waiting on sea shipments to restock.  I think I have been lucky to avoid pitfalls so far...\n\nJust finished reading all 3 years or so of history in this thread and have to say THANK YOU for doing this!  Oh man I've already bought and read your book too. I've learned (from you) that I've probably acted very rashly (little due diligence - bought on alibaba etc) and have certainly bought from a trading company but my first shipment went smoothly (though nowhere near the 250% margin you suggest).\n\nI have to say to anyone on the fence about getting Walter's book...GET THE BOOK!  I wish I would have found it a year ago when I started this search.  It provides every step of the process in exactly enough detail that you need to know!  No nonsense - no fluff. All the online gurus leave imperative steps out of the process...There were a lot of surprises and hidden costs that I was not expecting (inland freight, setup charges, duty charges, clearance charges, etc) with my first shipment simply because I was not informed.  (apparently you cannot just \"go and pick up your shipment from the airport\" as I was led to believe...sounds comical to me now)\n\nCurrently searching for the actual manufacturer (unsuccessfully so far) of my product to get my margins to acceptable levels or I may need to find a new product altogether.  Walter - could I PM you the details and get your suggestions?  Not sure about the etiquette on this forum.  I've searched through the sourcing sites you recommend but have only found more trading companies or unverified (no SGS report) suppliers that also have not responded to my initial inquiry.\n\nAs an aside I do have a couple generic questions: \n1) Is it common to have long lead times from suppliers?  My supplier has had about a 2 month delay before production even begins on my orders for this product on both my orders so far.\n2) My supplier also said there is only one factory in all of china that makes this product.  In your experience could this possibly be true?  I assumed it was a lie to keep me from looking elsewhere...but China is a big place\n\nedit: add second questionClick to expand...\n\nThanks for your kind comments.\n\nIn answer to your questions:\n1. 45 days is the most common lead time quoted, but as Chinese New Year approaches that blows out. 2 months is not bad at this time of year.\n2.

Don't know if they'll arrive marked in the same manner, as of right now.\n\n(1) Do I now have an \"importer number\" that I should be referring to?!\n\nAlso, I can grow into the \"fake\" name as I plan on incorporating in the coming weeks, but I am unsure as to whether the LLC name will be used when I make a bulk purchase before that.

No Worries.\n\nWhy worry about the possibility of duties increasing? We are in a world where competition is an everyday experience for those operating a business.\n\nAll businesses incur costs, and customs duty is one of those costs.\n\nYour competitors are in business, so they also incur costs, including duty.\n\nDoes payment of duty therefore make competition more difficult?  No \u2013 not unless your competitors cheat and somehow evade duty.\n\nWhen I began importing, duty rates ranged from the occasional low 5% (unusual) to a high of over 40%. That didn\u2019t stop me from outselling my competition, among whom were some who cheated.\n\nI know that at first when duty is increased and prices increase as a result, there will be some customer resistance, but customers do get used to the change. If selling B2C you can gradually increase prices to compensate for the higher duty, taking a profit cut while getting back to your usual margin. If selling B2B that can be a little more difficult, but your business customers will be paying more for everything that has a duty component. If they also are selling things that have a duty component they will also be increasing prices.\n\nStop worrying.

First I will answer some of your specific quotations:\n1. Vetting manufacturers is a procedure that not only involves checking their credentials claimed on B2B sites, but also doing diligent searches for them by various names, including omitting the city name that is a prefix to most Chinese business names. Checking their credentials means you don't believe a word of what is written in their B2B site listing, but you verify each claim.\n2. Ownership of molds you pay for is a vexed question when dealing with manufacturers in China. Theoretically they are your property. In practice your ownership hinges on the trustworthiness of the manufacturer. Some will use your mold to make products for your   competitors. One way to overcome that is to include you brand name and/or logo in the mold itself. That's not foolproof because they might sell the products to someone who will place their own brand or logo over the top of yours. There are many ways that can be done.  \n     Assuming they are ethical and keep the mold exclusively for you, it is common for molds to be held by the manufacturer for a limit of 2 or 3 years after its most recent use. If you ask for it to be sent to another factory, your supplier will probably tell you that it has been lost or damaged. Likewise if you ask it to be sent to a freight forwarder.\n\nWith all of this in mind, using a local manufacturer starts to look more attractive, almost regardless of product cost. You could have a mold made in China by a mold maker with no connection to the existing manufacturer, then have it shipped to your US manufacturer. You absolutely must have the US factory's agreement before starting down that track. I have known some to make all sorts of excuses as to why they can't use a Chinese made mold.\n\nNow for my questions to you. You might prefer to answer via PM.\n\n1. Can you use a mold for your new part only or do you need a new mold for the whole product? If it is for a part only, the Chinese mold maker might curry favor with the existing Chinese manufacturer.\n2. What material is being molded? The answer can have a big impact on my recommendation.\n3. How big is the part or the entire product?\n\nI might be offline for a while today, but will answer as soon as I can after re-connecting.\n\nWalter", "Good morning folks.

There are plenty of others who have far more experience than I in that field. I am well on my way through reading all 40 pages of Ecom man\u2019s thread, but I already see that he can offer some good advice on the product selling side.\n\nI have been self-employed since 1967, and I started with just enough cash to buy a typewriter and some letterheads. My first job after college was with a big shipping company. Eleven years after I started that first business in 1967 I began exporting my products to Asia/Pacific countries including China which I have visited on countless occasions.\n\nAfter selling that business in 1987 I began importing from countries including China, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Brazil. This new business sold products B2B. I had no retail sales. Business boomed and soon I ran out of family members to employ, so I expanded by selling franchises until I had franchisees operating my importing business in 4 countries.\n\nHeart surgery a few years ago forced me to sell that business but my brain won\u2019t slow down so I wrote my book and am now having more fun than ever helping new entrepreneurs get a safe start into importing.\n\nFire away with your questions.Click to expand...\n\nHi Walter,\n\nSo generous of you to share your experience on here, thank you.  \n\nI am actually looking to source a printer in China who prints on metallic BOPP film for our packaging for our chocolate products.

I get it for the units, because you have a weight with and without packaging. But surely the case weight stays consistent doesn't it?Click to expand...\n\nFirst, regarding your edit: CIF not only includes freight to your destination port, but also insurance.  In addition to duty and tax, there could be additional charges at your end, including Customs clearance work, and delivery to your address. If the shipment is by sea freight there could be a lot more also. If shipping by sea you should get a quote from a local  freight forwarder including all possible charges.\n\nQuoting FOB is almost the universal practice in China, whether for samples or large orders. FOB China is a vague term. They should specify which port, so for example it might read FOB Guangzhou. Unless they state the port, there is a risk that they are quoting FOB their factory which is in effect EXW.

In addition to duty and tax, there could be additional charges at your end, including Customs clearance work, and delivery to your address. If the shipment is by sea freight there could be a lot more also. If shipping by sea you should get a quote from a local  freight forwarder including all possible charges.\n\nQuoting FOB is almost the universal practice in China, whether for samples or large orders. FOB China is a vague term. They should specify which port, so for example it might read FOB Guangzhou. Unless they state the port, there is a risk that they are quoting FOB their factory which is in effect EXW.

In business #1 that need was for a technically superior product to replace one that had been on the market for many years and was a very poor performer in the production process for which it was being sold.\nOffer free samples of my improved product. This was done by personal cold call visits to local relevant manufacturers, and by mail to distant ones.\nBetter results were obtained by offering heavily discounted large samples, sufficient for testing in production runs at those factories. People used the samples they paid for, but often left the free samples on the shelf.\nIn business #2 the need was for more reliable quality, plus service better than the almost non-existent service that almost universally applied. \n\nAdvertising in Yellow Pages, (now almost obsolete.) Heavy spending but more effective than the much greater spending by competitors.\n\nLarge scale direct mail. Costly, but cost effective because I achieved a high conversion rate.\nCold personal visits to prospective customers. In one segment of the industry that was highly effective because competitors never called.\nDeveloped a method that I call \"warm calling\" for most other industry segments. This involved going to the receptionist, handing her (sometimes him) a sample, brochure, price list, and business card, and simply asking \"would you kindly pass this on to the person responsible for ordering such products. I then walked out. This was highly effective, often resulting in a phone call within minutes requesting me to return to talk. One such case was when the receptionist said \"we don't order things from here it all goes through head office\". I was about 300 meters away when I got the call to return and discuss a very substantial order.\nIn both businesses, establishing the need was the critical step.\n\nOccasionally I was contacted by a business that wanted a large quantity of something related to my product line, and I pre-sold it to them before importing it. This is sometimes called indent selling. It can be very profitable, but not easy to find such business. I never looked for it - it came to me.\n\nWalter", "Thank you very much for your detailed answer, despite it being a probably to broad question to ask.

Sprue primarily refers to a channel through which the injected material passes, but in many industries refers to the excess oozing out of the joins due to the injection pressure. A small amount is common, but with high quality molds it can be avoided. This means that to get the quality molding that you want, you might have to pay for a better mold, and depending on size, number of cavities (a jargon term for the number of items being molded in one shot) etc., and even the material being molded, cost can run into thousands, even in China.\n\nIf the item is being cast or molded in metal, the flash can be removed by tumbling. If the item is plastic, some manufacturers buff it off, but this can leave unsightly marks if the operator is not very careful.\n\nYou might have to coach a manufacturer, but what they agree to and what they do might be two very different things. Don't forget that for a Chinese person \"yes\" can have a variety of meanings ranging through to \"no\". They say yes because they see it as impolite to say no.\n\nI would still search for that elusive manufacturer whose quality standards already satisfy your requirements.

Does the website have any details (photos, address, etc.) of their factory?\n\nHave you read any SGS or Intertek reports on this company? That report will tell you on the second page whether they're a genuine manufacturer or not. EDIT: info redacted.\n\nAlso worth ringing up Dunn & Bradstreet to see if they have a Dunns number.

You should use a UK based freight forwarder, partly because the UK port system is such that unloading at the wrong port is not uncommon. Your local forwarder will be able to handle those complications for you, and it shouldn't cost you more provided they have given you an all-inclusive quote covering all costs to your delivery address. (Warehouse or home.) \n\nTheir quote might include an estimate of Duty and VAT, but you can't be sure of the amount until they pay it and ask you for it prior to delivery. They can often do that before the ship even docks.\n\nI think you might be calculating on the wrong basis. The case is the outer carton containing multiple items. They refer to it as a case when quoting weight but as a carton when quoting measurements. You just need to find out how many cartons there are in total. From that you could calculate the total dimensions, but it isn't essential for them to be on a pallet. I would leave that to the forwarder to suggest. The forwarder will do all the size/weight calculations if you give them all dimensions and weights and the number of cartons. They also need to know what the product is, quantity and value.\n\nIf using a forwarder, I suggest you ask your supplier to quote FCA (Free on Carrier At) their factory. Not commonly used and they might say they will quote EXW, but in that case you would need them to agree to load your carrier. If they don't understand the terms, FOB Factory, while not being strictly correct would be a term they would probably understand as including loading on board your carrier.\n\nI hope you have obtained your EORI?

For example there are two main options for fumigation: 1. Heat treatment such as kiln drying, and 2. Chemical fumigation, most commonly using Methyl Bromide, but there is a worldwide move to reduce or eliminate the use of this greenhouse gas.\n\nMost if not all of the gas evaporates long before the wood products would reach the US, but if the items are sealed in plastic very soon after manufacture there could be some release of gas when they are unwrapped. This is a very unlike scenario, mainly because manufactured wood products don't have to be fumigated, but should it occur, unwrap in a very well ventilated space, preferably outdoors.\n\nNo fumigation is required for things like furniture, picture frames, or carvings, but you need to be sure that the timber is not from a protected species of flora.\n\nWood used in packing freight is another matter, and must be fumigated. It is usually best to arrange with your own local freight forwarder to organize the fumigation and certificate in China. It's much easier to work with  someone who is just a phone call away. A freight forwarder can arrange everything for you from pickup at the supplier's premises through fumigation to delivery to your address. You must ask for an all-inclusive quote in writing, but there can still be surprises if for example your shipment is held up for inspection. Their charges will include a fumigation certificate if required.\n\nI have contacted my support team about the PayPal button not working, and will get back to you soon.\n\nWalter", "Walter Hay said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nMost if not all of the gas evaporates long before the wood products would reach the US, but if the items are sealed in plastic very soon after manufacture there could be some release of gas when they are unwrapped.

Think something equivalent to metallics, candy, fluorescent, pearl, variations of standard colors, etc.\nNot exactly those but something like that where it's more of a specialty.\n\nIt's not an easy color to pull off so I'm hesitant but since I'm going to order the samples anyway.. if he cannot produce it the way I want it to look in the samples, I'll let him know and ask that we try a different color (that's easier and more readily accessible).\n\nI'll ask him for an invoice though, esp when confirming the actual order.Click to expand...\n\nThat makes more sense.

Product sourcing specialist.\" I'm on page 9 so I have a long way to go until I am done. I am interested in your book and I want to know whether I should read your book instead of the forum as some of the earlier posts may be outdated by 2017. How much of the content in the forum is original and should I go back to reading the thread once I've finished the book?\n\nA: I am pleased that you have thought about the possibility of forum posts becoming obsolete. They do, and occasionally I have reason to post revised information, but I can't continually revise them all.\n\nThis is why I revise my book annually. The current edition is under review at present and might not be out until mid year. It's a big job.\n\nThe need for constant revision is also why all book buyers are automatically entitled to a free download of all revisions.\n\nThe current edition renders a lot of the forum posts obsolete, but is still of sufficient relevance that if I released it as new today I would be confident that I have provided probably the best and most comprehensive sourcing and importing guide available.\n\nAnd yes, I would recommend reading the thread because there are answers there to questions that I don't cover in my book.\n\nWalter", "I just went over the last couple of pages and liked your every post Walter.\n\nThere are a lot of very valuable threads on this forum, but many of the popular ones are very general in nature and/or have a lot of emotional content (which in no way means I think they are useless or not valuable, it's just that they're easy to relate to). Your thread is simply a relentless barrage of factual information that answers specific queries. \n\nWhy am I pointing this out, especially since you have a product to sell and we are your prospects?\n\nBecause not many people seem to realize the value of having someone like you answer specific questions FOR FREE in the public domain (membership on the forum is free as well). Often when I read your posts I'm reminded of a day or week or month in which I was completely preoccupied with an issue relating to my business (back then it wasn't even a business). I then think about how I learned the same things you said the hard way, risking my meagre capital and sacrificing my time. Yet you make it so simple for people. \n\nI only have some experience in product development, manufacturing technologies and materials and local sourcing, but for everything you say in those areas I always find myself nodding in agreement. \n\nSo here's a BIG THANK YOU for this thread!

I know it will save everybody's time to discuss it before the trial order, but I'm not 100% on the way to go about discussing it.Click to expand...\n\nThe difference between what you pay (by negotiation) for a smaller than MOQ order and what an MOQ order would cost is not as great as most expect.\n\nI posted on this subject in answer to a question in January, and have cut and pasted it here:\n\n\"You won't find any such chart unless the supplier publishes a price list. In any case you will most likely be disappointed to discover that the reality of discounts for volume is that they are small.\n\nNegotiating the best price to start with is the best way to go. People very often think they have found the best supplier because to their eyes the price looks very low. If you follow the right methods to get quotes, as outlined in my book, you can be reasonably confident that you are in fact getting the best price.\n\nAs a guide to the real situation, here's a brief extract from a price list published by one of my former suppliers from whom I and my former franchisees ordered several million dollars worth of goods over a long period:\n\nUnit price in US$\n100  0.76,  200 0.74,  300 0.72,   500 0.67,   1,000  0.64 ,   2,000   0.62   5,000    0.60, 10,000 0.56,     20,000  0.53,     50,000  0.505\n\n\nYou will observe a few things:\n\nThe first decent price break starts at 1,000 pcs. This is because that is the practical cost effective production run size that amortizes set up costs.\nThe next good price break starts at 10,000 pcs. This is the point at which production efficiency really kicks in.\nFinally, by the time they get to a price for 50,000 pcs, there is no real improvement in economy of scale. At this stage they are cutting margins to a fine margin, so much so, that even .005 c is worth them asking.\nThe volume discount amounts to 32%, but that deduction is closely related to their actual costs. If a supplier can't themselves obtain volume discounts for materials, and if they can't make real efficiency gains for increasing volume, they can't pass them on to you.\nYou will rarely find Chinese suppliers offering incentive volume discounts in the way we see in western countries. They really do work on a cost + basis. Initial quotes might be on a \"what the market will bear\" basis, but once you have succeeded in negotiating a price at or close to their real cost + basis, there is not a lot of room for them to move.\n\nBear in mind that they have to factor in exchange rate fluctuations, and the rises and falls in commodity prices. For this reason, don't condemn them if for your next order they quote a higher price. It might be due to those factors, or it could be due to them believing they have you as a captive customer. This is why you should always find backup suppliers.\"\n\nI would also add that rather than buy from agents because you think they will supply lower MOQs, you should negotiate a smaller order size with the actual manufacturer. I teach this as a basic principle.\n\nMOQs are rarely set in concrete.\n\nWalter", "Thanks @Walter Hay you are a wealth of information!", "Congrats @Longinus you get the book.

I will see if I can find the supplier's name for you.\n\nBecause you are establishing a brand, I can't let your post pass by without mentioning that I have just published a book which deals with how to create labels and packaging with selling power and how to use them to create a great brand. I will PM you with some information about it.\n\nNot all suppliers will have the same ability. Some might be able to supply holograms, but if they can't they should be willing to subcontract that. It's possible they might not know enough about them to even know who to contact, so I wouldn't count on it.           \n\nAs for price tags, do you really want your supplier to know the retail price? Having those printed locally should be a simple matter, but you might need to employ some casual labor to attach them.\n\nWalter", "Hi @hatzil I found the supplier the member finished up using.

Is there an average cost of how much these various exams may cost?Click to expand...\n\nI know what a worry these examinations and their cost can be. Although random exams are most common, many shipments are flagged on the basis of the importer's history or the history of the supplier/s. Others are flagged because of intelligence received, but that is not usually a worry to legitimate importers unless it is an LCL shipment. One of the smaller consignments in the container could be suspicious.\n\nVACIS exams, carried out using gamma ray technology, only take about 90 seconds once a container arrives at the head of the queue. The problem is that some shippers are certified under C-TPAT and their containers get preferential treatment. This can cause delays for ordinary shippers. Cost for a 40 foot FCL VACIS examination is $350 but there can be extras that can't be quoted in advance. These can include any transportation/trucking to the exam location, plus any PGA fees, if applicable.\n\nTail Gate, also known as Back Door exams, cost at least $100, but the final cost can't be known until the exam is completed. If nothing suspicious is found, the tailgate is shut and resealed for delivery.\n\nCES exam. This is the scariest of all. The good news is that by shipping a full container load you will have minimized the risk of a CES being required. They are usually only a result of a suspicious scan in a VACIS exam. If for example a secret compartment is seen inside the container, a CES will be carried out. Delays can be weeks, and costs can range upward from $500, plus the cost of the VACIS, which must always precede a CES.\n\nEnsuring your shipper is registered under the C-TPAT scheme is the best way of reducing the risk of CBP examinations being carried out.\n\nYou can find more information about C-TPAT here: C-TPAT: Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism | U.S. Customs and Border Protection\n\nWalter", "@Walter Hay , once again I'd like to say thank you for this thread.

My main reasons were:\n\nThey demanded too big a slice of the pie. The rule of thumb was always 50% off the RRP, but it was not unusual to find some that expected more, often in the form of subsidies for their advertising. \n\nBig stores expected extended credit, and I was not willing to act as an interest-free bank for them.\nSmall stores were generally in my opinion too big a credit risk.\nGetting the sales at big stores was far too time consuming, and I preferred to spend my time making much higher margin sales to other businesses, government authorities, clubs and charities, where repeat business cost me only courtesy calls.\nThe few small retailers I sold to were willing to pay COD for a small extra discount and re-ordered automatically, so risk was absent and effort was minimal.\nI preferred to sell bespoke items and this meant that I carried no inventory except for those few retailer customers. This business model was very attractive to my franchisees, because it required so little capital.\nSales resulted from advertising in print YP, later progressing to online, by direct mail, and by personal calling at the businesses either myself or by using commission reps. \n\nI used product sheets in my first major business, and they were sales sheets, describing the product and setting out the product's virtues, but they were very industry specific and technical, unlike the product sales sheets you would use if selling to retailers.\n\nFor more expert help than I can give, I suggest you look at posts by @G-Man and @amp0193.\n\nIf you want to make sales in bigger single orders with high margins, I suggest you think about B2B.\n\nWalter", "Hey Walter,\nMy product is a clothing product that requires embroidery, cloth labels, etc. after talking with Asian suppliers because my initial order is small the prices are high.

Retailers have a tendency to expect their wholesale suppliers to act as their bankers, providing credit, sometimes for extended periods. You may have to outlay a lot of money for your next shipment before you are paid for the first.\nBusiness failures in retail are very common, in which case you might never be paid. A big prospect might be sailing close to the wind when they place the first order and go into liquidation soon after receiving your goods. Worse still, it might be a repeat order and they haven't yet paid for the first one!\nIf all goes well and sales continue to grow, so does your capital requirement. Can you finance that out of profits, or will you need to borrow and incur extra costs doing that? Growth without capital backing is one of the major causes of new business failure.\nSorry to seem negative, but you asked about possible pitfalls.\nWalterClick to expand...\n\nThese points sound scary.

Only if you feel like it as this topic is not my top priority.\n\nMany, many thanks!Click to expand...\n\nHi Magneto,  I appreciate your kind comments.\n\nRegarding B2B selling, \n1. If you know the industry, I think you could do well, provided you can offer genuinely superior products. There are two parts to the industry that would interest you. \n1.1 Products used by the beauticians in their salons, and \n1.2 products they sell to their customers. If the beautician uses your product, they have a reasonable chance of making retail sales to their clients.\n\nTo make the best out of both, I suggest you offer to supply the product with the salon's own brand and label. Your price to the salon would need to be low enough to allow them to sell to their clients at a good mark up. Some salons won't want their own label, so you will need to create a memorable brand name and labels in order to sell to them.\n\n2. Provision of samples would be an essential step. Free samples for the salons would work well in that industry. Marketing to the end user in that industry generally takes two forms: \n   2.1 The first is basically gimmicky, describing on the label one or more of the ingredients in pseudo technical language, implying that having such an amazing ingredient will produce the desired result.\n   2.2 The second is imagery. By that I don't mean pretty pictures of beautiful models, although that is often part of the advertising. I refer to appeals to the imagination so that the women will see in that product what you want them to see. That can be achieved with words, pictures of models, colors, locations, shape of packaging and even price.\n\n3. I think you mean wholesalers. They would be the ones to supply the salons. I would bypass the wholesalers because:\n   3.1 No prospect of the salons selling to their clients unless the product is such a raging success that it becomes \"must have\" for every client.\n   3.2 Wholesalers are likely to demand a bigger discount than the salons would.\n   3.3 Salons, being mostly small businesses would be more likely to accept COD terms for a further discount. This would largely eliminate your credit risk. You can structure your pricing to allow for 5% or 10% for COD. You can explain that your wholesale discount to them is X%, but because you only supply on a COD basis, you will allow them X + 10%. There are various forms such a pricing structure can take, but I would only supply COD. That would usually not work for retail stores.\n   3.4 Offering a discount for payment with credit cards is also acceptable to many small businesses.\n\nCompetition will be fierce. Some salons will only use and recommend big names. This will mostly apply in upmarket salons in higher socio-economic areas (PC speak for upper class). \n\nYou will also, in some places, be competing with suppliers of products made to a price, and these will usually appeal to salons in lower socio-economic areas (=working class). If you can obtain your quality products at exceptionally good prices, you could still produce custom labeled products for those salons.\n\nDon't search for \"Private Label suppliers\". Search for businesses that do produce or are capable of producing the types of products you want.\n\nDon't worry too much about needing to order large quantities of labels for a big number of brands and label designs. Digital printing can make such small runs feasible. See my labeling book for ideas including sources in Australia. \n\nFinally Parallel Imports are big business in Australia. I will write up a post soon.\n\nWalter\nP.S.

This is different to air couriers. \n\nCargo consolidators collect the goods from your supplier just the same as couriers do and also sea freight shippers do. They hold them until they have enough cargo to fill the air container space that they have pre-bought. This means you are sharing the cost of that space, but shipment might be slow - maybe even 2 or 3 weeks.\n\nThere are generally much lower costs at air terminals than there are at sea terminals, so if the consolidator has obtained a very low per kg rate, they can pass on some of that saving to you. When the air freight per kg and the lower terminal costs are all added up it is not unusual for the total consignment cost to be less than shipping the same amount by sea.\n\nI will send you a link to the only Chinese freight consolidator that I trust. Their rates are very good and service as reported by their customers that I have spoken to is excellent. I will soon be sending out the link to all of my book buyers, but I am still doing my final checking on their references, so I don't want to publish it yet.\n\nWalter", "Hi Walter,\n\nSo I've managed to get a quote from a particular supplier I'm looking to work with, and compared to other suppliers they're quite pricey.

It will be a real eye-opener for many readers. I see one of the manufacturing processes shown is still using a product that I first exported to Taiwan in 1978.\n\nI have commented in earlier posts about the clinical cleanliness of many Chinese factories, and the serious attention to safety concerns, for example, lines that must not be crossed by trollies or forklifts. One of my oldest contacts, originally manufacturing in Taiwan, moved his operation to mainland China many years ago and now has over 6,000 employees there in 3 separate factories. He is currently looking to set up in lower labor cost countries!\n\nTaiwan is sadly overlooked by most new importers, but they are unaware that many of the best factories in mainland China have been set up and managed by Taiwanese companies. Most of those companies still manufacture in Taiwan, where technology allows for competitive pricing when high labor input isn't required.\n\nThe Taiwan Trade Center gave me a head-start firstly as an exporter, and they were invaluable when I started importing before the advent of the internet. I can highly recommend them. If traveling to China, a side trip to Taipei could prove extremely valuable.\n\nWalter", "Walter Hay said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nHe is currently looking to set up in lower labor cost countries!Click to expand...\n\nVietnam?

In many cases, probably most that I know of, they do fix the problem/s. Unfortunately though, that is a big gamble unless you know them well.\n\nRelying on Trade Assurance is just a \"feel good\" exercise IMO. It only works for buyers if they arrange for it to cover delivered goods. Even then, inspection costs would be close to the price you paid for the sample, so it's not worth the bother for small amounts.\n\nAs set out on Alibaba's site, the rules on Trade Assurance have now been expanded substantially, from 2 pages to 24 pages, and it is now so complex that it takes me 2 A4 pages in the latest edition of my book to explain it briefly. The rules now incorporate stuff that is not found in the rules! You have to look in the site's Help section for those extra rules.\n\nSorry you have had such a bad experience. I am writing this reply to help you in future but also for other readers.\n\nMy best suggestion is to prepare precise specifications, drawn up by an engineer familiar with the particular type of product being ordered. Your precise specific requirements must be included in your order, and you place the order conditional upon those being met. For pre-shipment protection, have the products inspected before shipment, (cost $200 -$300) and that way you can have protection, but only for the deposit paid.\n\nIf you arrange coverage for Post Delivery protection, you will incur costs of inspection (about $300) at your delivery destination. The conditions for protection are so complex and contain so many ambiguities that I would not rely on Trade Assurance. Here are the concluding paragraphs from my book regarding the subject:\n\n\u25a0 Before using Trade Assurance, it would be a good idea to carefully read all the Rules to be sure that you have dotted every i and crossed every t. You should also read the answers to all the questions about Trade Assurance found in the Trade Assurance Help Center. See link above.\n\n\u25a0 Data recorded by One Touch, Alibaba, and Alibaba.com constitutes almost the only evidence admissible in dealing with a claim. This means it is imperative that you keep screen shots of every transaction, every page visited, every attachment sent to you or by you, every email to or from your supplier and to or from Alibaba and OneTouch. You can provide other supporting evidence, but it certainly appears that Alibaba will regard it as inconsequential.\n\nWalter"], "Page56": ["Hi Walter,\n\nI appreciate all your insight.

What appeared to be an excellent record was not all that it appeared to be. I discovered that an associated company had been implicated in a freight scam. It was a totally separate entity, not a subsidiary, but I was able to identify common ownership. \n\nI had been in frequent contact with what I had been told was a good company to deal with, but knowing now about their shady side, I obviously won't recommend them. This experience leads me to again urge caution in allowing suppliers to arrange freight for you, or to arrange it yourself through a Chinese forwarder.\n\nI posted on this subject (Jul 25, 2017 #1358) previously, but my extensive recent research has found that the alarming incidence of shipments being held for ransom continues to grow. There have been so many cases over the past few years that it would make me very wary.\n\nSome of the cases have involved the setting up of bogus shipping companies, who issue fake Bills of Lading. Those companies come complete with forged business registration certificates, and websites that appear to be aged. Fake testimonials naming genuine businesses, mostly in the USA give a good impression.\n\nI checked out every testimonial provided by the forwarder I was assessing, and they were genuine, but when I found the website belonging to the other forwarding company with common ownership it was a different story. The first couple I checked were genuine, so they must have gone to the trouble of doing a couple of genuine transactions in order to get those testimonials. No doubt they expected that few people bother checking, and even less will check every testimonial.\n\nThe remaining US businesses named didn't exist!\n\nPossibly the most common form that the forwarding scams take involves the issuing of a genuine Bill of Lading, a copy of which is sent to the importer, together with a commercial invoice and packing list. They say that the original B/L is in the mail, but by the time the shipment arrives in your destination port the B/L has still not arrived.\n\nWhen you contact the freight forwarding scammer you find that they demand a payment that could be many times the amount you have already paid for freight. \n\nWithout the original B/L you cannot prove ownership of your goods, and Customs will not release the shipment without it either, so you either abandon the shipment you have already paid for, or pay up and hope they will send the B/L.\n\nI suggest that it is not worth the risk involved in saving a few hundred dollars on freight by using Chinese forwarders.

There you can not only verify with a reasonable degree of certainty that you are dealing with a real manufacturer, but you can see the product quality on the spot.\n\nFor any readers thinking of doing this, don't judge quality by the samples on display in their showroom, they will be usually be the best. Examine ones that are ready for packing.\n\nI have posted previously in this thread about visiting China, and I suggest you search for that.

What appeared to be an excellent record was not all that it appeared to be. I discovered that an associated company had been implicated in a freight scam. It was a totally separate entity, not a subsidiary, but I was able to identify common ownership.\n\nI had been in frequent contact with what I had been told was a good company to deal with, but knowing now about their shady side, I obviously won't recommend them. This experience leads me to again urge caution in allowing suppliers to arrange freight for you, or to arrange it yourself through a Chinese forwarder.\n\nI posted on this subject (Jul 25, 2017 #1358) previously, but my extensive recent research has found that the alarming incidence of shipments being held for ransom continues to grow. There have been so many cases over the past few years that it would make me very wary.\n\nSome of the cases have involved the setting up of bogus shipping companies, who issue fake Bills of Lading. Those companies come complete with forged business registration certificates, and websites that appear to be aged. Fake testimonials naming genuine businesses, mostly in the USA give a good impression.\n\nI checked out every testimonial provided by the forwarder I was assessing, and they were genuine, but when I found the website belonging to the other forwarding company with common ownership it was a different story. The first couple I checked were genuine, so they must have gone to the trouble of doing a couple of genuine transactions in order to get those testimonials. No doubt they expected that few people bother checking, and even less will check every testimonial.\n\nThe remaining US businesses named didn't exist!\n\nPossibly the most common form that the forwarding scams take involves the issuing of a genuine Bill of Lading, a copy of which is sent to the importer, together with a commercial invoice and packing list. They say that the original B/L is in the mail, but by the time the shipment arrives in your destination port the B/L has still not arrived.\n\nWhen you contact the freight forwarding scammer you find that they demand a payment that could be many times the amount you have already paid for freight. \n\nWithout the original B/L you cannot prove ownership of your goods, and Customs will not release the shipment without it either, so you either abandon the shipment you have already paid for, or pay up and hope they will send the B/L.\n\nI suggest that it is not worth the risk involved in saving a few hundred dollars on freight by using Chinese forwarders. If any Fastlane members have had good experience with any, I would appreciate hearing from you.\n\nWalterClick to expand...\n\nI used a Chinese freight forwarder who was recommended to me by my factory for my most recent shipment. They basically told me it was the company which handles all their exports to their customers.

I wonder how much will I get to learn from next 56 pages.\n\nSo I need some advice. I approached a wholesaler on Alibaba. They claim them self to be a wholesaler. The prices they offered are good a bit cheaper in comparison to other traders/wholesalers who have an MOQ where as this company has no MOQ limit. I can buy 10 pieces 5 pieces or 2.\n\nSo while I was having an e-mail convo after they explained their terms and condition they quoted me the price and suggested me to buy sample pieces and said all the samples along with shipping costs $65. Now, this is where I find it a little fishy. I'm in India and I've not mentioned anything about my where about how could they just randomly say that $65 is including shipping charge? Could this possibly be a scam?\n\nFurther, I've read your post saying that a company working in China can be authentic if they have a website ending with .cn.

Never take anything at face value.\n\nThe fact that you have verified the TUV certificates suggests that the supplier is OK. They might have simply assumed that you are in the USA, and based their quote on that. \n\nIf that is the case, you will need to be subtle about the way you raise the subject of your location. If you ask directly whether the cost will be the same to India, they will almost certainly increase it. On the other hand, if you proceed to order without querying cost relative to destination, they are more likely to supply at the quoted price.\n\nIf you like to PM me with the supplier's name I will be happy to check them out for you. It will only take me a few minutes. If you prefer to keep that information to yourself, that's OK.\n\nPayPal gives you some protection provided you take note of this: A number of unhappy buyers  have been denied protection by PayPal because they claimed \"Goods not as described\" after they had opened the package and found sawdust, stones 1/2 brick etc. Instead, notify PayPal of a fraud.\n\nI suggest filming the opening of the parcel.

It is not necessarily door to door unless that is specifically stated to be so, and unless the stated destination is your address you could be up for heavy costs in addition to the freight.  \n\nIt depends on what is the named place of destination. Very often, that named place will be the port of discharge, not your business or home address. DDU is used in place of the more up to date term Cost And Freight (CFR) which is identical except for the fact that CFR makes no mention of duty unpaid, although that is always what it means.\n\nOnce goods are discharged at the port (whether airport or sea port) you can expect to be hit with a wide range of charges. This is why I emphasize in my book the need to get a comprehensive quote for freight that must include all costs. In other words it must state door to door, including Customs clearance work, AND it must be in writing.\n\nA General Indemnity Agreement (GIA) and a Power of Attorney (POA) are usually required but for single shipments a forwarder will often only require a POA. If the shipment value is  more than $2,500 they will also required a Customs Bond.\n\nEven if the shipment is below $2,500 many forwarders will require a Continuous Customs Bond to cover them in case the importer defaults after the forwarder has paid the duty.\n\nIn summary, I don't like the idea of shipping on a DDU basis. DDP which is Delivered Duty Paid is preferable, but ONLY if the destination specified is your address, or if it is going to a fulfillment center, their address.\n\nWalter", "Hi @Walter Hay\nThank you so much for sharing such valuable information with us newbs.

I could end up working with 50+ manus and I can't wrap my head around the logistics. Let's say if everything is coming from mainland China, is there any way to consolidate all of the shipments over there then have it all ship at once? Could a local freight forwarder arrange something like this?\n\nThank you for your time.Click to expand...\n\nMany companies in China, such as ChinaDivision.com will receive small shipments, store them, repack if necessary, and put them all together as a single shipment.\n\nTheoretically that should save you money on freight rather than pay freight separately on each single shipment. Unfortunately, the freight rates usually charged by such consolidating services are very high. Many of the small Chinese forwarders have a bad reputation, and some are outright scammers, but I have been unable to find any bad reports about ChinaDivision.\n\nCurrently, Chinadivision are charging about US$12 per kg for express shipments, regardless of weight. \n\nLarge international logistics providers usually won't handle small shipments, but it is worth trying Customs Clearance, Freight Forwarding, Warehousing - Vancouver, Richmond, BC | CTC Logistics  This is a medium size Joint Venture enterprise between a Canadian Customs Broker We Are Toronto's Freight Forwarding Specialists and a Chinese company Acrowell International Logistics Ltd.\nI would be confident in dealing with such a company, but they don't publish rates.\n\nWalter", "Hello Walter, \n\nThanks for all your contributions to us newbie to importing. \n\nI have a question. \n\nI'm having problems with the suppliers from the sites you recommended in your book replying to my enquiries. \n\nI see a product I'm interested in, I contact the supplier to send a catalog and price list and then...silence. \n\nNo reply. \n\nI'm getting only about 1 reply in 20 contacts. \n\nIs this normal? \n\n\n\n\nWalter Hay said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nThat's difficult to say without knowing dimension of all cartons and the total dimensions of the consignment. I also need to know the weight of each. The reason you need to know the dimension is that although you might be quoted a per kg rate, the total volume is converted to volumetric weight using a complex formula and might well finish up much greater than the weight over the scales.\n\nFor example you might have a shipment weighing 200 kg over the scales but its volumetric weight might be calculated at over 300 kg. This is why you must know both figures and why you should get a total door to door cost for the shipment after both have been taken into account\n\nIt is not uncommon for freight to equal the product cost if paying for door to door air courier services. The use of the word \"express\" suggests that you might be paying a premium price for quicker than average delivery, but 14 days is not quick.\n\nAsk your supplier which courier service he is using. FedEx is usually the cheapest. Always be sure the freight is pre-paid. \n\nFedEx offer big discounts to many Chinese suppliers. Don't even consider arranging the freight yourself. Once you let me know the figures I might be able to help more.\nWalterClick to expand...", "banjoa said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nHello Walter,\n\nThanks for all your contributions to us newbie to importing.\n\nI have a question.\n\nI'm having problems with the suppliers from the sites you recommended in your book replying to my enquiries.\n\nI see a product I'm interested in, I contact the supplier to send a catalog and price list and then...silence.\n\nNo reply.\n\nI'm getting only about 1 reply in 20 contacts.\n\nIs this normal?Click to expand...\n\nI'm very sorry to say this, but I suspect that they don't reply because you are in Nigeria.

He places an order in the usual way, and his supplier accepts payment of the 100% by L/C. When production of the order is complete he travels to India where he inspects the products and supervises loading into a container. He has pre-arranged for a forwarder to seal and collect the container.\n\nI have suggested that he could save himself all that trouble by using an inspection service such as SGS but he says he has come to enjoy his trips to India, and his system works well.\n\nMy view is that for most people in this situation, using an internationally recognized inspection service is the safest option.

Here's an extract from my book: \n\n\"I looked at what importing guides are available online, and found that some of the information is misleading, much of it is out of date, some uses jargon that is not explained, some is unnecessarily complicated, and much of it is designed to try to get you to use someone else\u2019s services as \u201cfacilitator\u201d or \u201csourcing agent.\u201d They do this by giving the impression that if you try to do it yourself you are risking disaster.\"\n\nIn my opinion, this last sentence is a fair description of Sourcify. I read a sourcing article on the blog and found it full of dire warnings and exaggerations, as well as showing that the author lacks a real understanding of safe sourcing using B2B sites.\n\nWalter", "Walter Hay said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\nYes, when you know that one of the big retailers buy from certain companies you can be very confident that those companies have proven performance.

This is a common problem in dealing with Alibaba. They have made numerous changes over recent years, sometimes as many as three significant changes in one year.\n\nIn fact the Assessed Supplier category no longer exists, although Alibaba's help section still contains copious references to the non-existent category. In some of their articles in the help section they encourage people to filter for Assessed Suppliers, but no such filter is any longer available.\n\nThe onsite check is still, as it has always been, a token gesture that is worthless in assessing suppliers.

They now provide very limited information.

For someone just getting their feet wet in this area, what is your take on these options for sourcing:\na) Using a service like Import Dojo  I\u2019m sorry to say that ImportDojo are just another high priced Amazon teaching program and part of the upsell is to get you to pay them to do what they claim to be teaching you how to do for yourself. I have read a lot of their stuff and yawned. I must add that they are among the most professional of the Amazon experts selling courses (Jim Cockrum excepted!)\n\nb) Hiring a sourcing agent (upwork, fiverr, other website) I have two reasons for avoiding sourcing agents: \n\n1. I see it as an unnecessary expense, because with the guidance from my book, together with the support I give, primarily through Jim Cockrum\u2019s PAC paid support team that I have trained. \n\n2. It is practically impossible to know if the sourcing agent is working entirely with your best interests at heart (unlikely), or is he/she being paid by the supplier/s, or are the suppliers owned by the sourcing agent, or relatives or friends. \n\nSecret commissions are illegal in Western jurisdictions but they are commonplace in China.\nc) Doing it all yourself via alibaba, dhgate, etc\n\nI started with C and soon realized that I was out of my league when it came to products requiring a modicum of knowledge regarding US laws and certification requirements. In my book Chapter 3 Rules and Regulations I suggest consulting a Customs Broker for such issues. So a week or two ago I went with B, hiring a well-reviewed agent on upwork (a-z service, no bad reviews, etc). I place very little trust in reviews. Testimonials published online (such as on my ProvenChinaSourcing.com) can be subjected to scrutiny by the FTC, but reviews have often been bought.

I have 4 potential suppliers for a particular product.\n\n  2 of them are certainly manufacturers of this particular product. One of them has verified reports (TUV or SGS inspection) on their production capacity for this product specifically and even provides free logo branding and the other has many indications that they are producing this product themselves.\n\nThe 2 others are verified manufacturers too, but in their inspection reports there is no mention of manufacturing tools/machines for this product specifically. So they might be manufacturers for other products and just trading this particular product. One of these suppliers is the cheapest of them all ($1 cheaper per piece) and the other  provides a shipping option that is very attractive because the shipping time is 4 weeks instead of the 6 weeks (better for cash flow) that the other manufacturers and freight forwarders can provide.\n\nNow I could ask the 2 manufacturers/traders for pictures of their machinery/tools as evidence of them being manufacturers, but you never know whether they are speaking the truth. Let's say they can provide these pictures, would you choose these manufacturers because of their lowers costs and attractive shipping options instead of those that are surely manufacturers (for example they have verified production capacity reports)? Or would you choose one of the two other manufacturers because you can be sure that they are manufacturers?\n\nA possibility could be that the ''non-manufacturers'' are giving me low prices as a lead so I become a customer and in the next shipments not give any discounts that a manufacturer on the other hand can offerd to give.

They will often get a bigger discount than you could negotiate and they will (should) pass on a reasonable part of that discount to you.\n\nIf air couriers are used, the Incoterm should be either CPT (Carriage Paid To) place which would be your address or CIP (Carriage and Insurance Paid to) place. Again, this would be your address.\n\nIn practice, door to door air courier delivery is almost invariably DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) with destination your address, because the couriers clear through Customs for you, paying duty and GST/VAT as required and they get you to reimburse that before they deliver to you.\n\nI don't recommend requesting DDP because it tends to scare many suppliers who think it makes them liable for payment of duty.\n\nWalter", "Hello Walter\n\nI've got both of your books about sourcing products and private labeling, they are great sources of real unique information.

Unfortunately manufacturers in Western countries have an old fashioned mindset that sticks them in the rut of only selling to local distributors.\n\nMany don't even think of exporting, when in fact the world awaits!\n\nBecause sales to distributors are so easy, they don't want to bother with small fry. They fail to appreciate that a small customer can grow into a very big customer. There's no way to get through that barrier because the thinking is so ingrained.\n\nMy best advice is to look for small, preferably very small, manufacturers, and work with them. They will be the ones who want your business.\n\nWalter", "Hello Walter,\n\nFirst of all, thank you so much for all the helpful advice you have shared both on this forum and in your book. Both have been extremely valuable to me and I would to recommend your book to anyone here who is considering buying it, without hesitation.\n\nI'm currently in the process of sourcing a product I want to sell and after contacting about a dozen potential suppliers I've run into a couple questions which I've written out below. I don't recall seeing these elsewhere and I greatly appreciate any help you can give if you are willing.\n\n1) Some suppliers I have communicated with have quoted me prices that simply don't allow me to be profitable, even after lowering their original quotes. I know I can't use one supplier I had in mind for my product right now, however they did provide great service (even sending a free sample without being asked) and I don't want to burn any bridges in case they turn out to be a viable supplier for other related products in the future. Is there any way you would recommend communicating this to the supplier in a way that leaves the door open for future business opportunities? Or is it acceptable etiquette just to simply stop communications where they are for the time being and contact them again in the future if needed? \n\n2) So far I've found it takes lots of time to gather all the information I need prior to ordering a sample. Sometimes a week or two of daily e-mails back and forth will go by before even the samples can be ordered. In large part this is due to time zone differences causing long delays between e-mail responses and also some customization options for my particular product, but I'm not sure if this is a normal time frame. If a supplier lists their phone number is it generally advisable to call them rather than e-mail? On the one hand I think this could make gathering information and ordering a sample much quicker process, but on the other hand I worry about the possibility of information getting lost in translation, and the lack of any written communication record if something does go wrong.\n\nThanks again for all your help.", "If you have contacted about a dozen potential suppliers, that indicates that you are probably sourcing a generic product. If so, unless you can make it distinctive in some way, such as by the customization you mention, the amount of competition could be substantial with a price war eventuating.\n\nIn answer to your questions:\n1. Price expectations and the reality can sometimes be very different. Are you sure they really are manufacturers? Traders are far less flexible and are usually more expensive.\n\nIf you want to keep a supplier available as a possibility because of the good way they have responded, the proper course of action is to thank them in a very friendly tone for the excellent way they have dealt with your inquiry but you regret that you won't be able to do business with them this time.\n\nYou could add that you would be very pleased if they would let you know when they have any new products becoming available. After 6 to 8 weeks remind them of that. This will keep the budding relationship alive.\n\n2. Discussions via email can be painfully slow at times, but I would prefer the delays rather than calling them. Your concern about not having written confirmation of your discussions is very sensible. Many new importers like to introduce themselves and make their buying inquiries by phone, but they have to rely on hastily written brief notes made during conversations.\n\nPhone contact is recommended by most sourcing \"experts\", but they can lead to mistakes and even scams.\n\nA better way to speed things up is to email at a time when the supplier will be working, and tell them you will be online for X hours, and would appreciate a reply by then if possible. Tell them you don't want to rush them and you will understand if they can't reply in that time.\n\nYou might miss some sleep, but that might be worthwhile in order to make faster progress.\n\nWalter\nP.S.

I allowed them to source from any supplier they chose provided the products met quality standards. I actually taught them how to safely source products, and even as far back as the early 1990s, I showed them how to locate manufacturers in countries other than China.\n\nMost of them preferred to buy from the suppliers that I listed in the Operations Manual, partly because I had built a good relationship with those suppliers, and that meant they knew they would get preferential service and consistent quality.\n\nAlthough franchisees were bound by our agreement, I allowed them a lot of freedom. That made my life easier.\n\nAnother major reason they preferred those suppliers was that I had achieved the \"impossible\" in arranging monthly credit terms, and my suppliers automatically granted my franchisees the same privilige on my recommendation. I explain in my importing book how I obtained the privilege of ordering without paying a deposit, and not paying the total until 7 days after the end of each month.\n\nI know of no better way to ensure total quality control, because if the goods were faulty I didn't have to pay. Suppliers took my word when I told them about the faults, but I never took unfair advantage of that. Suppliers became my friends. Guanxi.\n\nWalter", "Dear Walter,\n\nMy other thread led me to a question that I have been pondering.\n\nIn the process you outlined in the book you go from asking for the catalogue to ordering samples in only 2 emails.\n\nI am a bit of a perfectionist and I might have done it the wrong way by asking too many question before ordering the sample. See they way I did it is email back and forth to gather all the information about the particular product I am trying to import. I would ask for details like what colors they have, battery capacity etc.\nAfter that I would also ask for things like custom logo (OEM), price for custom logo, FOB price and so on. The reason I did that was so that I can gather all the information from the suppliers and then make a decision on who had the best deal price/quality wise and then order samples from 1 tot 3 of the best suppliers (on paper).\n\nFor example, a supplier might have lower EXW price, but higher FOB price. They often don't mention the FOB price in the catalogue.\n\nAlso a supplier might have multiple versions of the product and it good to know the differences and the price differences between the versions. They don't always give a catalogue with all the versions.\n\nThe danger with asking lots of questions is that suppliers might find me annoying or don't take me seriously.\n\nBut on the other hand, I think finding the best deal/supplier is important, because there is some price and quality/features of the product differences between the suppliers and it might be good to know these details before ordering the samples.  A difference in $1 per product adds up quickly if you sell the product for the long term.\n\nSo my questions are basicaly:\n1) Is it a bad idea to ask lots of questions before making a selection from whom to buy the samples from?\n2) If it is bad, then how is it possible to make the best decision on which supplier to order (samples) from? Untill now if I would have ordered the samples within the first 5 emails, I would have missed lots of essential information about the pricing and quality (features) differences between the suppliers.\n3) Any advice on how to balance not asking too many questions vs choosing the best supplier for a particular product?\n\nI may completely think the wrong way about for example choosing the best supplier.

The spokesman agreed to this (although i have to pay extra for starting the production process) and called this order a ''sample order'' himself.\n\nNow I asked whether I can order a sample and he sends me a question asking whether I mean 1 pcs of sample or 120 pcs. I actually meant to order 1 unit to see whether I like the way they manufacture it. I asked for a different version than they usually produce (and was advertised for on the b2b site). I asked for example to put magnets in this product because most versions have this magnet in it, but the spokesman does not know exactly where the magnets should be put and we agreed that i would send a sample from another manufacturer to him to inspect. Also this manufacturer uses a different kind of wood than the rest.  So it does not give much confidence upfront.\n\nSo I would preferably order 1 sample to inspect the product, because I am unsure whether they will manufacture it.

Buyers just blind buy whole inventory?Click to expand...\n\nMany buyers do take the risk and buy blind. I would never do that.\n\nThe $460 setup charge is very substantial, and at this stage there is no way of knowing how it relates to their actual cost in setting up a small run. I prefer to offer to pay a surcharge for ordering less than the MOQ, and I would usually offer to pay $xx. What you offer really depends on how much you can afford, and what the unit price is.\n\nIt can sometimes cost you very little more to place an order for the MOQ than to pay a surcharge.\n\nSome manufacturers in a few industries publish price lists that include a surcharge for orders less than ....Qty. In those cases it is easy to choose to buy 510 pcs instead of 500 because in total, 510 will cost less than 500.\n\nMy big question at this stage is have they quoted you a price for the sample including door to door freight? You need to know this so that you can properly weigh up your options.\n\nInspections can be done at any stage you choose. During production is common, but inspection prior to loading is most often chosen.  If the inspection company rejects the product, whether during production or before shipment, the supplier has the option of manufacturing again, this time to specs, or refunding your deposit. They would rarely choose that option.\n\nIf they are reputable they will manufacture to specs the second time, but if they are not they will refuse to refund your deposit and simply thumb their noses at you.\n\nIt's worth noting that some importers tell their suppliers that they will arrange for an inspection, but they never do. The idea is that manufacturers don't like the idea of having a batch rejected, so they make sure the product meets specs.\n\nWalter\nP.S.

Have you ever heard of this website?Click to expand...\n\nI haven't heard of them previously, but a quick check revealed that they are very similar to the thousands of sites publishing buy and sell offers on commodities.\n\nTheir big difference is that they only publish sell offers.\n\nThe prices they list for some commodities range from very high to very low. The exporters, usually only middle men, who offer the very low prices will invariably haggle, because they are unlikely to sell at the published prices.\n\nIf they do agree to sell at those prices you will almost certainly find an amazing range of extra charges you have to pay.\n\nCommodity trading is quite a risky business even if you are experienced and educated on the subject.\n\nIf you are determined to buy and sell commodities, I suggest that rather than buying from middle men on sites like tridge  you would do better by making a direct approach to substantial producers in order to buy,  provided you have already found a likely buyer. That\u2019s not easy to do until you can be positive that your buying price is set in concrete, and you know exactly what costs will be incurred to deliver to your buyer.\n\nYou will also need to know how to arrange secure payment, and also hedge for currency fluctuations.\n\nAlthough I exported for 9 years on my own account and prior to that worked for years in the international shipping industry, I don\u2019t teach exporting or commodity trading,but I wish you well.\n\nMy importing book might help you a little because much of the information on importing is also relevant for your venture.\n\nWalter", "Walter Hay said:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2191\n\n@LPPC I appreciate your thoughtfulness regarding my time.

Is that reasonable?\n\nThis was like a test order to check for quality, so I ordered more than just 1 unit, therefore I doubt the supplier tried to rip me off on postage costs. Quite obviously, if I go for a higher number of units, then the shipping cost will go up as well and possibly I'll have to look into air freight or sea freight, rather than using couriers?\n\nSpeaking of couriers, I've been getting quite a few quotes for using EMS shipping, which is always the cheapest option, but since it's a Chinese courier, I've always avoided it, as I wasn't sure whether they would clear all the importing charges before delivering my parcel?\n\nI used Fedex a few times, who delivered my parcels without any prior contact and then just sent an invoice, showing what had to be paid (luckily all the duty costs were fine). So would EMS do the same thing, except with longer shipping time, as I would assume they are slower than the well-known couriers?\n\nIt seems like a waste of time and money to use air freight or sea freight for smallish parcels? Am I right thinking that air/sea freight should be used only for orders, which are heavy (100kg+) or so large that they have to go on a pallet?\n\nAppreciate all your help.\n\nThanks\n\nStephan", "@Blackman, Sorry I have been slow to answer. Personal reasons have led to me not being able to spend so much time on the forum lately.\n\nShipping costs are a constant problem, and I have always found the best way to handle the problem is to make sure that the prices I pay for the products will  cover the high freight costs and still allow a good margin.\n\nStill, the amount you have paid for that FedEx delivery seems excessive. I know that UK importers don\u2019t seem to get the same rates as those in the USA, and there is a lot of room for bargaining.\n\nTo show how difficult it is to establish what is the best rate, I can tell you that the rate you have paid is about 44% of the rates published by FedEx in China. The rate published for deliveries to the US is in fact higher! To complicate matters further, the rates are slightly less if the shipment is sent from Guandong or Fujian provinces.\n\nIf you can ship in FedEx 10kg or 25 kg boxes, the rate is substantially lower, but the weight is strictly checked.\n\nSince reading your post I have emailed a contact in China who might be able to provide better rates.\n\nThe FedeX practice of delivery without prior notice seems to be a UK FedEx thing, and I think is a good enough reason to use a different courier such as UPS.\n\nAir freight is rarely a viable option for small shipments due to high port costs. It can work if you use a freight forwarder who can consolidate cargo, but never consider doing it by yourself.\n\nSea freight for small shipments will often cost a lot more than air courier rates.\n\nEMS is actually a China Post service, and I have never found a problem with it.\n\nI hope this helps.

I am planning to ship this product that is made from PLA (Polylactic Acid) with the train from China to the Netherlands.

This means that if it gets hotter than 45 degrees Celsius, it might start deforming. The product has a component that is a sphere shape, so any deformity will be really noticeable.\n\nI have sent my forwarder an email regarding this (and the manufacturer too), but I thought it might also be  good idea to double check by asking you since it is a big and expensive shipment.\n\nCould you tell me whether this will become a problem or give me a way to find out about this? I will also be asking this on forums about chemistry.\n\nThank you!", "It is strange to learn of a PLA material with a glass transition so low.

I will keep having the forwarder do it.\n\nWith my previous order, it doesn't seem like inspection has helped much but it might be because of my own fault. I ordered 270 units and had inspection done. They inspected something like 80 of them and no major fault was found. Right now I have sold something like 30 units of this shipment and already 2 of them were defective because the charging plug did not fit into the charging socket. I did not have the inspection check the charging port explicitly, so it might have been avoidable had I put it into the inspection checklist.  Lesson learned to all readers: think of all the defects that the product can have and let them all get checked by the inspection service.\n\nWould you recommend having inspections done always for orders over 3000 USD that get shipped via sea or train, even though you have ordered multiple times from a manufacturer and it has gone well in general?  Because it might be the case that even though previous orders have gone well, one of the orders can get a very high defect rate and then you are basically screwed even more because you ship via sea or air. This could leave you with being out of stock for a long time (if shipping via air is not viable), not to mention all the hassle to get a refund etc. Do such cases happen often enough that it makes the inspection worth it?\n\nAlso let's say you find defective items once the shipment has arrived in country of destination. Then you tell your supplier that and ask them to credit you for next order. Would you recommend also adding the shipping cost of the single unit to the credit you ask of the supplier?\n\nThank you very much! + repped", "@LPPC Thanks for the rep transfer.\n\nYes the hassles involved in picking up from airport, sea port, or rail depot are substantial, as are the possible costs.\n\nI would never do it myself, although I used to.  When exporting, I had my own truck, and I would deliver the 1 ton shipments to the wharf, and if I didn't take my very young son with me, I hate to think how long I would have been just waiting around.\n\nThanks for your lesson offered to all readers. That is very valuable advice, and I hope they all take note.\n\nQuality inspections usually work well if the manufacturer knows the inspection will take place, but everyone makes mistakes, so I think an inspection should be part of your ordering process.\n\nEven in cases where you have a good relationship, and previous orders have been good quality, mistakes can happen. A change of staff in the supplier's quality control section can result in  a bad batch getting through.\n\nSometimes inspections on quite small orders can save you losing all the money you have paid. Try to allow for the cost of an inspection when working out whether or not to buy a particular product. Is the margin there?\n\nIf you can provide photographic or video evidence of the fault, and you are very polite about it, any supplier worth having will credit you with the cost of the rejects.\n\nTry to offer a compromise so that both sides win. Maybe you could offer to pay some of the freight cost, or as much as half. You will lose that money but build a great relationship if you want to continue dealing with that supplier.\n\nI assume that when you wrote: \"Would you recommend also adding the shipping cost of the single unit to the credit you ask of the supplier?\" that you were referring to the original sample.\n\nIf so, I would say no - let sleeping dogs lie.\n\nSometimes, losing some money is the cost of building Guanxi.\n\nI am writing here from my experience, and can tell you that yielding the unexpected, resulted in great service and excellent quality control, as well as a no questions asked willingness to give a full refund whenever I reported faulty goods.

Faults became rare.\n\nWalterClick to expand...\n\nYour advice is taken. Building relationships is indeed very important ofcourse.\n\nI hope you don't mind me asking another question. I have until now ordered from 2 manufacturers for the same product:\n\nManufacturer A) 9 defects out of 153 units, 5.88% defect rate. Price per unit: 12 USD\n\nManufacturer B) I bought it from my supplier that acts as the middleman between me and the manufacturer. Price per unit is 9.5 USD. They have the most beautiful version of this product. They customized the product for me to have a bigger battery size. They changed the motherboard for this also. Those were all good points.\n My first order with them were 40 units. Defect rate was 5%. This batch was really bad. The battery capacity of the whole batch was 30% of what they promised, barcodes were wrong, half of the units came totally empty and had to be charged first etc. My supplier said that they just moved to a new building and thus they were really busy (around 20th of january) and on top of that they could not use their stable motherboard but had to modify it for me. That might be the reason for the bad batch.\nMy supplier agreed to provide me double the amount (80 units) as refund with a proper battery. I agreed to this. The sample showed that the battery was indeed good, but the LED colors were off because the motherboard they ordered were not programmed well. I could either decide to have them produce these 80 units now or wait after CNY. I decided to have them produced or else I would be out of stock.\n\nQuestion 1: Would you consider giving manufacturer B another chance by ordering 3000 USD worth of products and having a pre-shipment inspection done by TUV?\nUp until now me and my supplier have not found a manufacturer that  produces this product as beautiful as the version of manufacturer B. This manufacturer also has a very low price and they customized the product for me without a MOQ or a much higher cost.\n\nOn the other hand they have been really sloppy until now, but that might be because of CNY and their change of factory/building. Maybe a pre-shipment inspection by TUV will eliminate a big portion of this risk. And since you recommended to have an inspection done for every big order, I could do this inspection for every order from them.\n\nIf they can produce this product for me long term with an acceptable defect rate, then I might have a good product that differentiates itself by higher battery and beautiful finishing. So maybe it is worth the risk, or it might be very foolish to give them another chance.\n\nLooking forward to your opinion on this! Ofcourse, in the end I will take all the responsbility for whichever decision I take.", "@ LPPC Your question and my answer could be very helpful to others also, so I am pleased that you have asked it.\n\nKnowing that your margin is big enough to allow for the cost of a pre-shipment inspection, and in view of their helpful attitude, I would not hesitate to order from the trader.\n\nIt is obvious that they have very good connections with factory that makes the product.

I have read your informative book as well and am already tuning my eye to watch out for those deceptive agents pretending to be manufacturers!\n\nSorry if this has been asked before (I am on page 22 on this thread and slowly making my way through it) but, how can you tell from inspection reports if a supplier is in fact a manufacturer? For example, I am looking at a SGS report and under Company Type, it gives 4 options: Manufacturer, Combined, Trading Company and Group Company. Are they a real manufacturer only if they have the Manufacturer box checked off? What does Combined and Group Company mean?\n\nAlso, I have a red flag going off since under Production Capacity of the report, it mentions Own Brand, ODM and OEM with 32 R&D staff but no mention of actual output production quantities. Am I correct in thinking that this might not be a manufacturer?\n\nThank you in advance!!", "@personallegend, It's good to be skeptical, but only the option: \"Trading Company\" makes it certain that the supplier is not a manufacturer.\n\nIt is by far the best if only \"manufacturer\" is ticked, but there are many companies in China that are jointly owned, or so closely aligned with a manufacturer that they are as good as being the manufacturer. These would often be covered by the term: Group Company.\n\nCombined means they manufacture and trade, so there is always the possibility that they don't manufacture the product you are looking at.\n\nIf the SGS report says they have 32 R&D staff, they would in almost every case be manufacturers.

The problem with that is that they can tell you it is part of the mold, when they have in fact cheated by using an insert with your logo on it.\n\nThat makes it possible for them to remove your insert and replace it with either a blank insert, or one with someone else's logo. In effect you have paid for a mold that will be used by/for a competitor.\n\nThe only solution is to pay for an inspection service to check that it has your logo embossed or debossed as part of the mold.

That means in November of 2010 alone, gold increased in price by 2 percent and silver by 14 percent. Investing in gold and silver beats saving money in a bank earning less than 0.1 percent per month. Once again, this is further evidence that savers are losers as central banks of the world print trillions of dollars.\nWith paper money declining in value, millions of people are finally climbing on the gold wagon. Everywhere I go, I see signs that say, \"We Buy Gold,\" calling out to people desperate for cash to trade in their gold jewelry.\nFor years now, I've said that silver is a better investment than gold.\nTo quickly summarize, here are a few reasons:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Silver is consumed and gold is hoarded. \n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Silver is a precious metal and is also an industrial metal that is used in electronics, medicine, water purification, and jewelry\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Today stockpiles of gold are increasing while stockpiles of silver are decreasing. (This means there's an abundance of gold and a shortage of silver).\n\n\n\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The gold/silver ratio is historically 14:1. This means that if gold were $14 an ounce then silver would $1 an ounce. Today, the ratio is approximately 50:1. Silver is extremely underpriced. If silver held to the historic 14:1 ratio, with gold at $1,400 an ounce then silver should be $100 an ounce -- not the $30 an ounce it is today.\n\nIn my opinion, when you combine the fact that there's a shortage of silver and that it's underpriced, silver is the safest and best investment today\u0085but not for long.\nA logical question is, \"Why is the price of silver suppressed? Why is silver so much lower than gold?\"\nThere are two primary reasons for silver's low price.\nNumber one, central banks buy gold, not silver. To bankers, gold is money and silver isn't. Today central banks are buying tons of gold, with India being one of the biggest buyers. This elevates the price of gold, leaving silver the bridesmaid but not the bride.\nThe price of silver is manipulated. The price of silver is intentionally kept low. While this is criminal, it's not illegal. Yet for decades, COMEX, the commodities exchange, has been in cahoots with the biggest silver investors at the expense of the little silver investor. This is about to end, thanks to some regulatory changes that may offer the biggest opportunity for silver investors between January and March of 2011.\nWhat has changed?\nRumors are flying that more than 25 lawsuits have been filed against commercial investors such as JP Morgan and HSBC, accusing them of price manipulation to keep the price of silver artificially low.\nThe Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which is to the COMEX what the SEC is to the New York Stock Exchange, has passed a new law which will force COMEX to play fair, forbidding such massive short positions on silver.. The actions of the CFTC are one more reason for last November's 14 percent price rise in silver. The price manipulation of silver is about to end.\nHow was the price of silver kept low?\nBig investors short-selling silver have kept the price low. For decades, the biggest players in the silver market, commercial investors such as JP Morgan and HSBC, have taken massive short positions on silver.\nWhat does short selling mean?\nShort selling (shorting) means you sell something you don't own. Simply put, you borrow something to sell with the promise you will return what you borrowed.\nIt's not much different than going to your neighbor to borrow 5 pounds of flour and promising to return 5 pounds of flour in a month.\nShorting is done in all markets: commodities, stocks, bonds, and real estate.\nThe commercial banks, generally large banks such as JPMorgan and HSBC, sell borrowed silver from the COMEX and pocket the money. The banks use that money to invest in other higher-returning investments such as stocks or bonds.\nMeanwhile, COMEX has earned billions of dollars from the interest on the borrowed silver. The commercial banks and the COMEX both profit from this large short position of silver, the larger the better.\nNow, with the new CFTC law, the commercial banks will need to buy back silver and return it to the exchange. The problem is not a money problem. The problem is a shortage of silver.\nWhen the commercial banks start buying rather than selling silver, this will cause the price of silver to rise, increasing the costs to replace the silver. It's simple supply and demand.\nThis massive big short has left the banks with a large margin-call when a broker asks an investor to bring an account up to a minimum position. How big is the margin call in silver? It is estimated that the total net short position on the COMEX is 550 million ounces of silver. And that's just on the COMEX. Worldwide, it's estimated that the short position is 2 billion to 3 billion ounces of silver.\nIf this is true, that means 2 billion to 3 billion ounces of silver have been borrowed and need to be purchased and replaced.\nAgain, the problem is not a money problem. The problem is that there's not enough silver to cover the margin-call.\nWhen will this margin-call occur?\nThe laws passed by the CFTC and Congress take effect by March 2011.\nIf the laws aren't repealed, the big commercial banks will be forced to buy silver to replace the silver they've been borrowing. When they buy, the price will go up.\nAnd if the price of silver goes up during this buying period, their losses will grow like an atomic mushroom cloud. This means that the big banks and COMEX will be doing everything possible to keep the price of silver low so that they can buy silver to cover their exposed positions. In the next two to three months, you will probably see huge swings, up and down, in the price of silver.\nI've been buying silver for years, starting at under $4 an ounce. One year ago, silver was about $17 an ounce. Today it's about $30 an ounce. I believe $50 to $60 an ounce is possible for 2011.\nI believe it's possible to see the price of silver gain more in one year than it has gained in the past twenty years.\nAs I close this column, I advise you to read this great interview of Ted Butler, the person who has for years single-handedly been demanding Congress to force the COMEX and big commercial banks to play fair.\nAs Ted Butler states, \"It is time to sell gold and buy silver.\"\n\nsell-gold-buy-silver: Personal Finance News from Yahoo! Finance", "Ratios AND trades need a time component aspect\n\nToday Gold to Silver Ratio is 48:1\nAs recently as last July the ratio was 70:1\nHistorically the ratio has averaged 16:1\n\nAs pointed out in the article, for these reasons some folk have been buying Silver (more accurately, silver derivative products).\n\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say the silver:gold paired trade was a much better wager last July than today.\n\nMost folks are not aware that twice in the past 100 years the ratio has gone as high as 100:1, during times of extreme financial imbalance.\n\nFurthermore, when one looks at the LONG term ratio charts, you can see that silver had traded at a much higher premium for several centuries in the Roman period and in the Middle Ages, at times breaking the 10:1 barrier.\n\nAs with any other financial play, it all comes down to time horizon.\n\nOver the last year, Ted Butler has been right as rain.  Yet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the last decade I have communicated with Ted Butler he has been OUT of the Money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c gold was the place to be!\n\nA good place to start initially is with the first graph on this page (The 600 year silver chart):\nhttp://www.rapidtrends.com/silver-to-gold-ratio/\nalso hosted here:\nhttp://goldinfo.net/silver600.html\n\nFWIW, I think this chart is actually incorrect in that the ratio for silver actually shows as too overweight during the middle ages based on other data I have seen (the 2,000 year charts).  The comparison gets difficult because silver traded day to day as currency whereas Gold typically only exchanged hands for large land swaps or political deals. \n\nGovernments throughout the globe have attempted to fix the price of gold since government began.  They actually achieved some success about 1,400 a.d. to ensure relative stability amongst economic pacts between each other.  Silver had been allowed to float for many centuries (and thus become debased), whereas gold was only allowed to float beginning in 1973, more or less.  \n\nThis silver devaluation trend continued even moreso after the Polosi Strikes by the Spanish in the Andes in the 1500s.  Silver became the de-facto currency over most the trading world, and eventually the value was debased.\n\nHere is a good study on the value of silver, as paid for working me wages, over the past 500 years (start on page 37):\nhttp://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/Members/robert.allen/WagesFiles/wagesnew2.pdf\n\nYou can see silver became cheaper, compared to hours labor necessary to procure, after the precious metals strikes in California and Nevada in the mid 1800s.  \n\nSilver became so cheap, relatively, that the bankers could no longer make a profitable spread to suit their tastes.  Hence, they engineered the panics and depressions  of the 1890s and 1907.  The US presidential election of 1896, to large degree, was based on the battle between whether Gold (Republicans) or Silver (Democrats) should be the coin of the US realm.  \n\nGold won.\n\nJust ten years later the bankers were no longer satisfied with the Gold carry trade, and they instituted fiat currency via the 1907 panic and the resulting Federal Reserve Act six years later.\n\nYou can find some more long term price comparisons here (Long term Inflation in US and UK):\nhttp://www.measuringworth.com/inflation/ and Measuring Worth - Measures of worth, inflation rates, saving calculator, relative value, worth of a dollar, worth of a pound, purchasing power, gold prices, GDP, history of wages, average wage\n\nThere are a few thousand gold/silver ratio and price performance charts that go back 30-100 years.  There are a couple hundred good charts/graphs that go back to the middle ages. \n\nSince I started looking in 1999 I have only seen five or six decent 2,000-4,000 year charts, and regrettably can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t locate at the moment.\n\nAgain the trade comes down to your timetable.\n\nOf course, most folks only have a two year time horizon anyway!
